Although he embodies the spirit of classic House Music forms like old school Jackin and '90s era Chicago House, his underlying philosophy is quite simple - construct a beat that taps into the primal and speaks to the universal love of dance shared around the world. Growing up in the UK, Weiss accumulated a diverse range of musical tastes and influences, from Metallica to Motown and Phil Collins to Disco. An apprentice to Massive Attack’s Musical Engineer James Day early in his career, Weiss was able to draw from that deep well of inspiration and expert technical training to produce what would become a trove of instantly recognizable classics and unique, chunky, club rollers. /  / Weiss’ initial success as a producer was immediate and profound. His hit single “My Sister”, released in 2013, hit the top of the Beatport Charts and stayed there for four months. Assisted by a generous amount of support from BBC Radio 1, his sounds caught the attention of industry heavyweights like Annie Mac, Groove Armada, Green Velvet, Loco Dice, and Kenny Dope. After several years of successive hit radio singles like his 2016 “You’re Sunshine”, which premiered on Danny Howard’s BBC Radio 1 show and netted a spot at the top of the Beatport charts, Weiss’ profile continued to expand. It wasn’t long before his musical contributions and electrifying performances began to transform the modern House Music landscape. /  / With support from / JASON WOO / THICCOAS CAGE / ABRAHAM /  / ---- /  / Field Trip is our night for electronic music - mostly house, trance, breaks, and bass house.

Born in Dusseldorf, DJ T. (aka Thomas Koch) relocated to Frankfurt with his family in the late 70s. During his formative years, he fell for the hypnotic grooves of disco, inspired by his parents’ record collection. At the age of nine he was already completely enraptured by music and that love affair continues until this very day. He began an obsessive quest to collect music, feeding his soul with everything from Disco and Hi-Nrg, through to early Hip-Hop and Electro, Soul, Funk and R’n’B. The groovy, infectious rhythms of all those genres continue to permeate into the music he makes and plays today, providing an intrinsic part of his sound ethic. /  / He took up breakdancing, before becoming a DJ, playing at private parties initially before landing his first professional gigs in the late eighties. This period proved to be a pivotal moment in his life as Acid House swept through Europe, landing in Frankfurt and taking over with the launch of Sven Väth’s legendary Omen club in 1988. The first wave of House and Techno took hold and T. was there at the forefront, absorbing all the fresh new sounds from Chicago, Detroit and the UK. He picked up a residency at the infamous Music Hall and held residencies at countless clubs across the city during the next 10 years from Plastik and Dorian Gray to The Box. By the end of the nineties, he was one of Frankfurt’s best-known selectors. /  / In 1989 DJ T. tapped into another side of his creative energy to set up Groove Magazine. Identifying a gap in the market and fuelled by a need to satisfy his own desire for specialized music journalism, which focused on his interests – namely underground dance music. Under his leadership the magazine was launched into the public’s consciousness and he guided Groove to become one of Europe’s premier dance music publications, which it still is today. /  / DJ T.’s progression continued at a pace, as he launched his own club, Monza, using the experience gained through a decade of club events and tours under the Groove Magazine banner. He also invested his skills and knowledge into conceiving Get Physical – a label, which remains one of the world’s best- known House and Techno platforms. Though he left in 2010, T. still occasionally A&Rs for the label, lending his uncanny ability to uncover new talent to the seminal label. /  / Production-wise, he has been consistent ever since his debut release, the ‘Monsterbaze’ EP with Steve Bug, which was released on Poker Flat in 2000. Since then, T. has released several well-received EPs, a slew of remixes and three albums, ‘Boogie Playground’ in 2005, ‘The Inner Jukebox’ produced with Thomas Schumacher in 2009 and ‘Pleasure Principle’ in 2011. His special touch has also been employed by numerous labels to curate compilation mixes, including ‘United Under The Ball – 30 Years Of Disco’ in 2011 and ‘The House That Jack Built Vol 1 & 2’ in 2012. In 2013 he celebrated 25 years of DJing with a very personal mix compilation, followed also by ‘Body Language 15’ and collaboration with Defected and Strictly Rhythm to celebrate the latter’s 25th anniversary. DJ T.’s reputation for being a master selector has been cemented by these superlative collections of music, each of which has received widespread praise, often featuring many of T.’s own edits of classic tracks. /  / Despite so many accolades, his passion for music remains staunch, recently making several key changes to his professional life that have inspired him to explore new terrains. With hot new releases on AUS Music, Moon Harbour, True Soul and Jackathon representing his continued desire to push his creative boundaries. /  / A highly-skilled DJ and producer and an A&R with an uncanny ability to discover and nurture new talent, DJ T. is a master selector and one of the industry’s most influential figures. /  / Celebrating 30 years in the business with another world tour, he has brought his art to the Americas and Europe since the beginning of 2019 and will continue until the end of the year. For a few weeks now the cat is out of the bag: DJ T. has taken a new wave of inspiration to the studio where he is currently producing a new album for his old label Get Physical Music, the 4th one of his career. The album will see the light of day around early spring 2020, following a successful series of EPs, that have been released since last year and will be continued until the end of 2019. The name of the album («Trans Orient Express ») says it all, DJ T. is drawing a lot of world music influences from the cultural circles of the orient to inject them into a wide spectrum of Nu Disco aesthetics. A new world tour will follow the album from the end of March 2020. /  / https://www.facebook.com/deejaytea/ / https://www.beatport.com/artist/dj_t./10742 / https://soundcloud.com/djt / https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/djt / https://getphysicalmusic.com/ / https://www.discogs.com/artist/214669-DJ-T / https://twitter.com/DJT_akaT_Koch / https://www.instagram.com/dj_t._official/ /  / >> dubspeeka /  / dubspeeka is a Bristol (UK) artist who’s unique techno/house has given quick rise to their persona.

Technology changed the game a lot but the goal remains the same.” /  / Ben learned to mix in 1996 and just 2 years later became resident dj at the famed Moontribe Gathering, and started his own production company, Tropical. The first half of his career was mostly focused on DJing abroad, leading to 13 trips to Moscow’s Propaganda club, travel all over Russia, Spain, and Mexico, an appearance at Wiggle at Fabric in London and two at the Labyrinth Festival in Japan. /  / After marrying his love Jessica in 2009, Ben refocused efforts more locally, and is now one of the top West Coast festival DJs with recent appearances at Oregon Eclipse, Motion Notion (Can), Cascadia (WA), Lightning in a Bottle, Sunset Campout, and Desert Hearts (CA), among others. /  / Celebrating its 21st anniversary this year, Tropical has evolved from humble warehouse beginnings to 500-person summer boat parties and the legendary Tropical Oasis Retreat, an event which has brought together top artists from the West Coast 7 times in California and most recently, Kauai and Maui, Hawaii. A breath of fresh air in the sometimes ego-dominated dj and party world, Ben has donated over $30,000 to charitable causes through Tropical. /  / After 20 years of producing Tropical from Los Angeles, Ben Annand moved to Maui for 6 months to produce his top event production to date, the 300 person beachfront microfestival Tropical Oasis Retreat Maui March 29-April 2. Returning to the West Coast in late April, Ben went straight onto a 5-week tour with his family, finally landing in Eugene Oregon in June. Within a week in Eugene the Annand House Café was born, and the next chapter begins! /  / https://www.benannandmusic.com/ / https://www.facebook.com/benannandmusic/ / https://www.instagram.com/benannand/ / https://www.residentadvisor.net/profile/benannand / https://twitter.com/benannand / https://www.facebook.com/tropicalevents/ / https://www.facebook.com/moontribe/ /  / >> Rob Noble /  / Hello, my name is Rob Noble and I've been an active member, DJ, and event producer in the NW since '00.

His sets tend to defy the idea of a single genre, incorporating multiple styles into a tight, fluid & cohesive mix that takes the dance floor to new heights, becoming something new and exciting every time. /  / A love for rhythm and syncopation, movement and energy, and that deep, dark and dirty bass has always been the driving force behind his mixing, programming, and track selection.

As well as releasing on many noteworthy labels, he also has his own imprint to showcase the scope of his productions. Titled Ego Death, the label explores themes of existentialism, duality, and what it means to be an artist in the modern era.

In this format Uun constructs thousands of studio hours into a powerful contained experience. Each outing can greatly differ as new elements are always added. He has brought this unique approach to underground events all over the USA, as well as choice bookings in Europe at Tresor, Griessmuehle, Gegen, as well as Khidi in Tbilisi.

Under these aliases you’ll find sweeping emotive cuts, verdant dancefloor workouts and discerning dips into jungle and breaks. Releases have come on respected labels including Meda Fury, Ectotherm, UN.T.O and Lobster Fury: the collaborative label from Lobster Theremin and Meda Fury begun for the explicit purpose of releasing his tracks. /  / DJ Seinfeld’s beats are ultimately guided by an idea of authenticity, true to the spirit of the early house pioneers and the unabashed rawness the confines of their equipment demanded. A lot’s been made of this lo-fi fuzz, with many clamoring to declare it a scene, but he won’t be put into a box. His path is his own. A microphone picks up the tension and release of a singer: charged with emotion, the machine can’t handle it. The rough edges of his productions emit the same sensibility. / Footage of his gigs or their post-show reaction exemplifies the reception he gets as a DJ. Biographies often claim a DJ regularly ‘sends crowds into rapture’ or ‘lays waste to the floor,’ but in DJ Seinfeld’s case pandemonium is the default. Mixes show his deft control of build-up and feel in the booth, while his mini series for legendary London station Rinse FM in May ‘DJ Seinfeld presents...’, was a master class in the kind of wonky left-field house he peppers his sets with. /  / ……………………………………… /  / Sign up for the Kremwerk + Timbre Room Complex mailing list on our website, to stay in the loop about upcoming events, ticket giveaways and more! / http://www.kremwerk.com/ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk strives to be a safe space.

The nonstop set consisted of original, improvisational, neoclassical avant-garde material generated exclusively for this thematic, site-specific engagement. The recital took place at high noon, cascading up to 20 keystrokes per second per hand, reverberating skyward through the monolithic edifice. A butterfly cemetery underfoot.

His dance floor oriented DJ sets often reflect Shameless' aesthetic by focusing on forward thinking music while cherishing the gems of the past. About 8+ years ago he began a yoga practice which has continued on today. His eclectic interest in music and desire to bring yoga to the dance music community led to DJing the first Yo Yo Yoga event at the Electric Tea Garden with many more to follow. /  / RHETT ~ 1LUV  /  / RHETT delivers a dynamic array of rhythm when on the decks. He cultivates the congregation by dropping a combination of DIRTY-BASS, reverberating layered sound & BIG LUV to the dance floor, which can only be portrayed as 1LUV! In his compilations RHETT infuses an eclectic, pulsating blend of house, booty tech, tech house, breaks & techno! As a purveyor of BIG LUV, he serves a mix of prodigious vibrations that will make your BOOTY BOUNCE & your HEART FLUTTER! /  / AUNDREA ~ 1LUV / During the 1990’s under the alias Aundroid, a new Dj, all of 20 years, old gained a new style, under the mentorship Grandmaster T.C. Izlam, RIP 2017. Her rise opened the door to residencies along the West Coast. Having played with some of the most talented artists including opening for The Black Eyed Peas, helped her to combine ‘juggling’ NY drum-n-bass vinyl to mixing hard house, UK garage, and Detroit techno.  /  / Since the 90’s Aundrea has continued to push the bounds of her craft highlighting each individual track by ways of eq’ing, dramatic effects among unprecedented ways to ride and build the timing of a drop. Its best to experience it firsthand to understand this concept. Upon listening, the risks frame the outline of her style; intentionally distracting the dancefloor with what they are not going to hear. Fans describe her music as ultra-original with consistently inconsistent effects highlighted by various levels of unnerving crescendos. Its magic. Again, it must be experienced. Check out Aundrea’s mix and hear for yourself. /  / BUCKMODE ~ 1LUV ~ https://soundcloud.com/buckmode / BuckMode is always sure to get things bouncing with his booty shakin’ sound that refreshes your souls from the inside out! A large helping of BuckMode on the decks has been known to cause BSS (Booty Shakin’ Syndrome.) His passion for music and love for the industry shines throughout his musical compilations. When BuckMode is behind the decks he will surely leave you weak in knees! You have been warned!","('47.577129', '-122.334469')"

From her highly lauded collaboration with Sasha ‘Förbindelse’ that scored an Essential New Tune, to her stunning debut on Kompakt’s Speicher series ‘Tears’ and the relaunch of her Power Plant label with the exquisite ‘Aphelion’ EP, her elegant take on house and techno continues to captivate. /  / Creative freedom and a deep connection to her environment have fuelled the artistic endeavours of Sanna La Fleur Engdahl stretching back to childhood. Born in the Swedish city of Örebro, weekends were spent playing and exploring the forests surrounding her home, alongside lessons in piano, flute, ballet and later singing. In the years following, she graduated with a Master in Pharmaceutical Science but eschewed a career in pharmacy to focus on music full-time. Later Power Plant was launched with the incandescent classic ‘Flowerhead’ with the project becoming a multi-disciplinary breeding ground for different creative pursuits, with music always at the core. /  / The former Mixmag breakthrough artist is in high demand for her DJ skills, playing an almost unheard of three sets in three months on BBC Radio 1 last summer. She first shared the stage with Cassy and B.Traits for an inspiring B2B2B during the Radio 1 Weekender in Ibiza, followed by an acclaimed Essential Mix, before dropping a Hot Mix on Pete Tong’s show to celebrate her much-talked-about collaboration with Sasha. Recent and upcoming gig highlights include Sonus Festival, Tomorrowland, Melt!

Engaging in her sets is like sitting with her at a card table while the chaos of the casino persists in the periphery: glances of determination alongside a type of stoicism about fun are passed around, undermining your confidence of the game, questioning your initial goal to win, diffusing what you thought it meant to win at anything.Known internationally during the IDM days as The Square Root of Evil, Jen now delivers dense, driven techno, as solid as urban pavement. Nancy Dru is where Jen's personal and deep comprehension of sound marches through each corner and transition of her set. Rendering her work more potent is its vocal aridness. Though this style is alive with language, it is an idiosyncratic, non-verbal kind, accessible to all who are at least level two versed in techno. Having shared the stage with the likes of Steffi, Voices From the Lake, Carl Craig, Headless Horseman, Shed, Hodge, Dasha Rush, Rødhåd, Erika, Kangding Ray, Andy Stott, Annie Hall, Matrixxman and many more, as well as playing celebrated sets at Basscoast, Mutek, Soundwave, and Communikey, Jen has gained a laudable reputation as not only an artist with a severe approach to music, but also as a techno advocate with an esoteric, tenacious language, argot required for propelling the global dance community forward into its unknown, tremendous future. /  / Tickets Available soon! /  / =========== / Timbre Room / 1809 Minor Ave / Seattle, WA / 21+ w/ID / =========== / Timbre Room does not tolerate bigotry, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, misogyny, ableism, or any discriminatory actions.

However, one day during this period, for the Feast of St. Patrick, the church lifts all restrictions allowing for the loss of all inhibitions and pursuing vices with reckless abandon. On this day, the Irish stuffed themselves with their favorite foods and drank their favorite whiskey...sometimes a bit too much whiskey. While intended to be a religious holiday honoring Ireland’s patron saint, because of the lifting of moral restraints, it became a celebration of celebrating for celebration’s sake. More than that, it became a celebration of the Irish people themselves.  /  / So on this St. Patrick’s Day, when everyone is allowed to be Irish for a day and are free to indulge themselves to their heart’s content, there’s no better music to lose yourself in than that of house. We’ve assembled a collection of some of the best local DJs, all of whom are eclectic in their own way, but are particularly skilled at the craft of house music, to make this a night to remember: /  / Performing at her first NorthLeft show, 𝗗𝗬𝗥 (𝘜𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘴 | 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵), we’ve never had an event better suited her. From a rich Irish background, Colleen Burns, AKA DYR, is an expert executioner of a wide spectrum of genres including house, techno, disco, often weaving multiple genres into a single set. This innovative young DJ has gained a lot of momentum as of late, which is in large part due to her prowess at house. The stark upward trajectory of DYR’s career has given her opportunities to be featured at some of Seattle’s premier venues including the Kremwerk-Timbre Room Complex, Q and Re-Bar. She not only is becoming increasingly prominent in her hometown, she also is branching out internationally, performing at venues in Reykjavik, Iceland and Budapest, Hungary. /  / Another DJ who has huge momentum right now is 𝗝𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗺𝘆 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻 (𝘋𝘓𝘊 | 𝘜𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘦_𝘙𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴). Since the first of his many NorthLeft performances, Linden has become one of the hardest working DJs in Seattle, with frequent performances all across the city at its most well known venues. Just as the rest of the members of the lineup, Jeremy can spin a plethora of genres, but he particularly excels at house music. An advocate of the Seattle house music scene, being an essential figure in the launching of the Seattle Church of House Music to prominence, he is an expert at straight forward pure house, deep house and his own unique brand of 4/4 with a sound that has heavy house overtones. /  / If Seattle has a house purist, it is it’s native son 𝗝𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗲𝗿 (𝘚𝘵𝘶𝘥𝘪𝘰 4/4 | 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘥 𝘗𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘴). He is one of the most sought after house DJ/producers in Seattle, especially when it comes to providing support for touring international headliners or performing at events that are local house music institutions. Since its humble origins, house music has evolved into a dynamic genre spanning a wide spectrum of different variations of the core house aesthetic. There is no more knowledgeable student of all these variations than Jesse. While largely focusing on house, he is known for his ability to be eclectic with sets that span house music’s entire spectrum in a single set. /  / Lastly, there’s the hybridic DJ 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗸 (𝘕𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘩𝘓𝘦𝘧𝘵 | 𝘗𝘪𝘜𝘯𝘓𝘛𝘋) whose style typically resides in the gray areas between house and techno. Recently though, he’s rediscovered his house music roots and has been fervently engulfing himself in the genre. However, Shamrock being Shamrock, his recent house sets mash and mangle several subgenres of house into an organized chaotic exploration of 4/4. Largely relying on certain types of tech house, he also integrates progressive house, deep house, deep techno and even some leftfield.  /  / This March 17th may be a Tuesday, but do as the Irish have always done...blow off your responsibilities, don’t think of the consequences until the next day, wear your green and dance the night away with us on this very special night.  /  / While St. Paddy’s is a day of indulgence, if you indulge a bit too much, please make sure to have a designated driver or some other alternative means to get home. We want you home safe. /  / 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗲 𝗥𝗼𝗼𝗺 / 1809 Minor Ave  / Seattle, WA /  / 10PM - 2AM /  / $10 at the door / $5 advanced tickets /  / --------------------------------------------------------------------- /  / Kremwerk and Timbre Room strives to be a safe space.

The same year, the “Techno Corner” EP was released on Form Music, his friend Popof’s label. A remix was also commissioned by Moby (“Stay Down”). In 2011, he confirmed his standing in the Techno scene by releasing his second EP with Plus 8 Records (Hermanos Ep). /  / In 2012, Julian Jeweil released his third EP with Plus 8 Records (Bastard EP), featuring five tracks played and supported by the greatest artists out there. One year later, he started the year the best way he ever could have, with two remixes for prestigious artists Deadmau5 & Pan-Pot that both charted #1 in the Beatport Techno Top Ten. They were followed by the excellent “Mad” EP with Form Music. /  / Julian also signed in 2013 three releases with Minus, Richie Hawtin’s renowned label: “Don’t Think” EP (Number one in the Beatport Top 100), “She’s Hot” EP, and a remix for the Techno Master, Adam Beyer, who produced alongside Ida Engberg the track “Unanswered question” on Drumcode. In 2014, he released two more EPs with Minus: “Rumble” and “Los Pistolos” E P. /  / In 2015, amidst an increasingly dense touring schedule, more releases were met with astounding success: a new EP, “Bird”, on Minus and a remix, “COAR,” commissioned by artist Marc Houle for his album Restored (release date: April 2015, also on Minus). Fall 2015 in particular saw a series of remixes released – commissioned by legend Pete Tong, Sian, Pig & Dan and Joseph Capriati. September also saw one of the artist’s greatest achievements: four of his tracks were simultaneously listed in Beatport’s monthly Top Ten Best Selling tracks : “And We”, “Meteorite”, “Bird” and “Wax”. End of 2015, Julian Jeweil was officially crowned Number 1 Techno DJ on Beatport. In 2016 Julian Jeweil released another EP on Form Music, “Destination”, an instant success critically and commercially.  /  / One year later, following an intensive touring schedule highlighted by multiple performances worldwide on the Ultra Music Festival/Resistance stage, the French heavyweight resumed working with Adam Beyer and released his first - and hugely successful - two EPs on Drumcode, “Rolling” and “S pace”.  /  / In 2018, Julian Jeweil was finally ready to release his first LP, “Transmission” LP, also on Drumcode. The album was an early 2019 monstrous hit, generating multiple Beatport chart-toppers and hitting the Top 3 All Genres charts. /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk / 1809 Minor Ave. / Seattle, WA / http://kremwerk.com / 21+ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Sign up for the Kremwerk + Timbre Room Complex mailing list on our website, to stay in the loop about upcoming events, ticket giveaways and more! / http://www.kremwerk.com/ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk strives to be a safe space.

Founding member of the legendary group Underground Resistance as a ‘Minister Of Information’ with ‘Mad’ Mike Banks & Jeff Mills, his seminal works on Jeff Mill’s Axis and his very own M-Plant imprint paved the way for a wave of stripped-down dancefloor minimalism that directed much of techno’s path throughout the late Nineties. /  / Robert Hood makes minimal Detroit techno with an emphasis on soul and experimentation over flash and popularity. /  / Having recorded for Metroplex, Jeff Mills’ Axis label, as well as Patrick Pulsingers ‘Cheap’ label, Peacefrog, and more recently Music Man, Hood also owns and operates the M-Plant imprint, through which he’s released the bulk of his solo material. /  / He has only released 2 ever CD mixes one for French label Logistic, and a mix for the club ‘Fabric’ mix series��”Growing up in Detroit, I grew up with Motown in the house – a lot of Motown and Philadelphia soul, artists like Marvin Gaye of course and Curtis Mayfield. /  / I remember Isaac Hayes, the soundtrack from ‘Shaft’ had come out. My father was a jazz musician; he played piano, trumpet and drums. My mother was in an R’n’B group.� We listened to a lot of Motown – in fact, my grandfather’s first cousin is Berry Gordy.� “I was influenced by my father – I wanted to play trumpet like he did.”� Robert’s father tragically died when he was just 6. The photo of Robert sitting down holding a trumpet is his fathers. �”I had to beg my grandmother to let me borrow the trumpet to take a picture with it” /  / In the early 90’s he began to concentrate on his own production ‘Vision EP’, the ‘Riot EP’ and X-102 were big stepping-stones for him as they were the first releases he worked 100% on his own. The X-101 to X-102, were Waveform Transmission projects with Mills for Tresor. He slowly progressed to work more and more on his own, but collaberated on some of the first Axis releases with label owner Jeff Mills as H&M (Hood & Mills) with ‘Tranquilizer EP’ and ‘Drama’.�� He soon decided it was time for him to start his own label to focus on what was in his soul musically. /  / M-Plant started in ’94. I had developed this “grey area” sound – what I mean by that is that in Detroit, even when the sun is out, there’s something in the atmosphere. I don’t know if its pollution or whatever, but the sky has that grey haze over it. It’s got to be something from the industrial factories there. I’d never really heard a sound like that before and it came from a Roland Juno – it was a chord sound that really went along with my depiction of what Detroit was at that time. A lot of buildings were abandoned and there was a lot of lifelessness in the city, especially downtown. The M-Plant, in minimalism, kind of reflected that. /  / I remember thinking of Detroit like a museum. You know, like a work of art standing still, suspended in time. There wasn’t a whole lot of activity going on. /  / Releasing singles such as “Internal Empire”, “The Protein Valve”, “Music Data,” and “Moveable Parts”, “The Pace”, more recently “Range”, “Alpha” and that isn’t even touching his other monikers Floorplan, Monobox, The Vision, etc.� “M-Plant is what I’ve always wanted to hear: the basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what’s essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. “It’s a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound. M-Plant is just M. minimal.” /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk / 1809 Minor Ave. / Seattle, WA / http://kremwerk.com / 21+ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Sign up for the Kremwerk + Timbre Room Complex mailing list on our website, to stay in the loop about upcoming events, ticket giveaways and more! / http://www.kremwerk.com/ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk strives to be a safe space.

Bill’s wife owns a local publication and is a skilled bicyclist (even though she has not gone professional.) /  / When David works in his studio where he makes electronic music, his wife brings him a drink and discusses her day. The door-keeper comes in to give him a telegram sent the previous year from the Eolian Islands. /  / In 2010 he wrote an album of music which was released by Freerange records. A year later David’s first and only daughter, Eloise Sylvia was born. She was 5 pounds 11 ounces at birth. David spoke only English and cooked meals for his family every day until 2013 when a company called Systematic Recordings contracted him for another album. /  / Besides writing music for night clubs and headphones, Pezzner composes music for vision and function, and teaches electronic music writing concepts to anyone who will pay him money. He sleeps exactly like any other man but, as you will no doubt have noticed, he is not an orthodox painter of the old school, but rather a modern artist. A designer. / ---------------------------------- / Shameless was established in 2003 in Seattle, starting off as a weekly underground dance night in the basement of the Alibi Room.

It took George Evelyn from his electronic-genre-blending debut 1991’s A Word of Science, into releasing the iconic downtempo, soul and hip hop material for which he has become renowned. Music lovers from around the world were intoxicated by this bassy, afterhours sound that became the backdrop to a million late-night living room sessions. Smokers Delight managed to capture that feeling and add a dash of light to the darkness, changing the musical landscape for Nightmares and the still young Warp label forever. /  / Evelyn’s recent output includes the critically and commercially acclaimed Nightmares on Wax Back to Mine compilation, released earlier this year, which saw him take the helm of the compilation for its 20th Anniversary, and his long-awaited eighth album Shape The Future [2018].

Joe action figures in the early 80’s, Detroit native Marcellus “Malik” Pittman was playing his radio at maximum volume, listening to the sounds of “the Wizzard” and the “Electrifying Mojo”, in addition to the jazz outputs of Rosetta Hines. /  / Malik began his DJ pursuits for college parties, wedding receptions, “old school parties” in the early 90’s. In 1993, Malik released his initial work of production with local Hip-Hop collective “Home Grown”. /  / Shortly thereafter, he released “Essential Selections, Vol. 1” on the Sound Signature label, headed by Theo Parrish. In 1998, Malik forged a working relationship with Rick Wilhite, Theo Parrish and Kenny “Moodymann” Dixon, collectively known as the 3 Chairs. As production artists and selectors, they have helped to define an integral part of the Detroit sound.Malik’s sound has been around the Detroit and surrounding areas, as well as internationally, spanning Canada, the UK, Germany, Japan and Paris. /  / His dedication to production ushered the discontinuation of his latest residency with Northern Lights in Detroit. Malik is currently heading his own label, Unirhythm, which will release his upcoming projects. /  / RICK WILHITE / Rick Wilhite’s position within the ranks of his Detroit peers and amongst the city’s respected house music heritage is impressive. Learning the trade from scratch, Wilhite went through the experience of being a record buyer as well as a record dealer with his own store (Vibes – New and Rare Music), worked on the other side of the fence as a producer and editor for labels like KDJ, Stilove4music and as part of the infamous Three Chairs collective (Kenny Dixon Jr., Theo Parrish and Marcellus Pittman being the other members). Rick has also worked alongside peers and pioneers Derrick May and Juan Atkins, recorded as DOC, Tech-12, Working Mixx or The Godson, and has always been a mover and shaker behind the scenes.

Oscar G /  / OSCAR G –Made In Miami /  / (Made In Miami, Murk, Nervous Records) /  / As one half of the Murk production team along with Ralph Falcon /  / If you were to get out a map and track the history of house music – with endless lines sprouting from New York, Chicago and Detroit to points all over the world – you’d have to make a big, red circle around Miami, Florida, and start drawing. /  / Miami was never ground zero to a full-fledged sub-cultural movement. But it is where Oscar Gaetan, better known as Oscar G, has lived every day of his life. And that fact alone makes it a hub on the global underground. /  / An award-winning songwriter, producer, and DJ, Oscar is one of dance music’s brightest and most enduring stars. As part of seminal production teams Liberty City, Murk, and Funky Green Dogs, he boasts hits – Billboard chart-toppers as well as underground smashes – in every decade, every trend, and every market. “Some Lovin’,” “Fired Up,” and “Dark Beat” are more than just tracks: They are moments, shared by clubbers worldwide. They’re the kind of moments Oscar still creates at clubs worldwide, as he continues to headline the world’s premier venues and sell out shows with each appearance. /  / Oscar and longtime friend and production partner Ralph Falcon grew up in a Miami enlivened by the fresh spirit of hip-hop. “Break dancing, graffiti and the music that went along with it: That’s really what got me into DJ-ing in the first place,” he says. By the age of 12, he was already spinning at school dances. /  / Oscar and Ralph started working together at the end of high school, blending the sounds of their youth with the beginnings of house, like Ten City and Blaze; and the darker Euro bands of the time, like Depeche Mode and New Order. “We were always big on doing our own sound, with our own feeling and vibe in every aspect of it; from the way we mixed things to the sounds we chose,” says Oscar. “I remember being obsessed with that for years, and then people started to listen.” /  / The early years bore some of the work for which they’re still best known, like often imitated, never duplicated vocals “Some Lovin’,” “If You Really Love Someone,” and “Reach For Me” (Tribal). Upon their release in 1993, the pair became instant superstars. “Europe kind of grabbed us,” says Oscar, so they spent a good amount of time touring overseas, eventually visiting every major and minor outpost of the global dance scene, including Zouk Singapore, Ministry Of Sound London, and Stereo Montreal. /  / “Fired Up!” (Twisted), their biggest hit ever, followed in 1996. It topped the Billboard Dance chart, and even cracked the Top 100, peaking at No. 80. They would go on to remix countless major pop artists, from Madonna to Cher to Donna Summer; and appear on mainstream outlets like MTV and Top Of The Pops. The boys also cut two complete Funky Green Dogs albums for major label MCA, “Star” (1999) and “Super California” (2001). But their own measures of success were still decidedly underground: “Once Junior Vasquez played our records at Sound Factory [in New York], we felt like we could retire, and at that point we were like 20,” says Oscar. /  / In March 2000, Space opened in downtown Miami with Oscar as the Saturday night resident, just as the world was paying its annual visit for Winter Music Conference. The club – with its cavernous main room, pummeling German sound system and nitrogen blasts – was the talk of dance world, and the legend of Oscar’s residency began to grow. Eventually Oscar’s marathon Space appearances during his 8 year residency would become essential rites of passage for anyone who wanted to experience Miami nightlife. /  / The year 2003 was a big one. Oscar released the “Live @ Space” (Star 69) compilation, and won the Club World Award for “Best Resident DJ” (which he won again in 2007). Murk set a new Billboard Dance chart record, with five No. 1’s in a single year: Four singles from their self-titled artist album on Tommy Boy Records, and “Dark Beat” (Twisted), tribal house’s first real vocal anthem, which found its way from dance floors onto mainstream radio. “We came up with ‘Dark Beat’ in about 15 minutes. Whenever things come that quickly, you know there’s something to them,” says Oscar. “But we didn’t think radio or anthem; we were thinking more like, ‘Oh man, Danny Tenaglia’s gonna be all over this!’” /  / In 2006, Oscar became one of Pacha New York’s only non-NY-based monthly residents, strengthening his bond with his home-away-from-home, and its rich dance history. He released a second installment in the Space series in 2007, starting new relationships with Nervous Records in the U.S. and CR2 in the U.K. CR2 also snapped up the Murk catalog, and commissioned new remixes of the classic tracks, including Paul Woolford’s takes on “If You Really Love Someone” and “Reach For Me.” /  / While visual content in connection with music has been vital since the emergence of MTV, Oscar had the foresight to see that this would soon play a role in DJ mixed packages as well. In 2007 he released a documentary / long form music video included in the Oscar G / Space Miami audio release on Nervous and CR2, and he went one step even further in 2009 in releasing the Oscar G / DJ (DēJā) CD / DVD. The DVD for that package was a complete visual recording of 70 consecutive minutes of one of Oscar’s legendary Space Miami sets, and is considered the definitive visual rendition from this seminal venue. The DJ (DēJā) release was also the source of three Oscar G singles that became anthems at clubs worldwide; specifically “Back To You,” “What You Need” and “Your Love,” all of which featured vocals from his long-time collaborator Tamara Wallace. /  / In addition to the two DVD’s, the year 2008 marked the release of Oscar’s debut album as a solo artist. Released on both physical and digital formats, the release of “Innov8” on Nervous Records would also mark the beginning of an especially prolific production period for Oscar G in terms of album releases. 2010 saw the release of “Live From NYC,” a DJ – mixed compilation recorded live at Pacha NYC; in 2012 Oscar released a mixed CD entitled “Beats” to great acclaim and followed that up in 2014 with Beats Vol 2; in 2016 Oscar released the double CD Beep My Boom artist album, which was also the source of another immediately embraced anthem entitled “Rain feat. Seri.” /  / While his reputation as a solo artist has continued to grow along with his well-known persona as one of the world’s premier DJ’s, Oscar has also continued to do special collaborative projects with his Murk partner Ralph Falcon. Together they produced one of the definitive underground house anthems of 2012 entitled “Amame feat. Jei” under the artist alias Intruder. This single was released worldwide on Defected Records. And he and Ralph also re-activated the seminal label Murk Records. At the same time Oscar in 2016 also launched the Made In Miami record label, which has emerged as a premier platform for both veteran and new Miami talent. /  / Even though his passion for music creation is undeniable, it’s in his DJ booth where Oscar feels most at home. “On the music side, I’ve felt pretty energized lately, because the changes in the industry really enable you to be a lot more experimental and take more chances,” he says. “But DJ-ing to me always comes first: I really believe in it as an art form. Having a residency like Space, with a regular crowd, it’s the ultimate.” /  / His connection with the house music fans of New York has always been strong, and the past few years has seen residencies at Output in Brooklyn, and Space Ibiza New York in Manhattan, both of which lead to multiple sold out appearances. With Brooklyn the new epicenter of nightlife in America, Oscar has been invited to play virtually every significant club in the borough, and has continued to sell out shows with each appearance. In his hometown, his annual Made In Miami Pool Party in March is now known as one of Miami’s most important events celebrating homegrown talent. In addition he maintains two weekly residencies in the 305. Fridays he is at 1-800-Lucky with his Rice & Beats Party, and Mondays he is in Coyo Taco’s event room in Wynwood with his Murk Mondays event brand. /  / Earlier this year in Feb 2019 Oscar released his “For The Culture” album on Nervous Records. For this project Oscar presented 12 original recordings that musically expand the boundaries of what fans typically expect from the genre, but at the same time retain the tribal house based, thick and layered percussive house elements that he’s known for. /  / For The Culture” included musical contributions from several of Oscar’s music collaborators in his hometown of Miami including DJ / Producer Lazaro Casanova, live percussion specialist and vocalist Oba Frank Lords, producer Stryke, vocalist Katiahshé and brass player Ronald Rodriquez. /  / January 18th 2020 lets welcome Miami's premier ambassador of HOUSE MUSIC!

To illustrate: if you buy a ""5am to 2pm"" ticket, your first entry should be between 5am and 2pm, but you can stay and re-enter until the party is done; if you buy a ""2pm - close"" ticket, you can only enter after 2pm on New Years Day. /  / - Once you've come in during the designated window time on your ticket, you can come and go as you please. If you don't enter during the designated window of time, you'll lose your spot and need to buy a new ticket (assuming there's space inside). Once you're inside, can also stay as long as you'd like as long as you abide by our safer space policy (more on that below). /  / ☻ THE REFRESHMENTS: /  / - We have a 24 hour liquor license for this so it will be possible to buy alcohol at the bar all night and day. /  / - If you're coming to the Planetarium portion of the party (6pm - 10pm) food from Diner by The Izakaya will be served buffet style between 6pm and 7.30pm. /  / - We'll have bar snacks and paninis available from 10pm onward and we'll have some breakfast items available from 7am onward. /  / ☻ SAFER SPACE: /  / In an effort to create a space where all people feel safe, we don’t allow any of these things within our walls or in our back yard: /  / ⇢ Violence / ⇢ Non-Consensual Touching / ⇢ Racist, Homophobic, Transphobic, Sexist or Other Discriminatory Language / ⇢ Leering /  / If someone says or does anything to make you feel uncomfortable while you’re here, let us know.

Clay Wilson’s hypnotic music has been the foundation of his releases on The Bunker NY, as well as his tripping live sets that combine years of studying free improv with an innate feel for techno and beyond. With only a couple of tracks out overall, rrao has been quickly turning heads with their ethereal take on both ambient and rhythmic electronics that induce trance-like meditative states, and has a solo release coming on our label this year. Both artists are also professional sound engineers who are dedicated to getting the most out of whatever sound system they’re playing on. /  / We can’t think of a better way to close out this night than handing the reins to long term resident DJs and acid brothers Mike Servito and Derek Plaslaiko for one of their legendary b2b sets.

AT THE LAB w/ Gilles Peterson, Lefto & Brownswood Soundsystem! If you can't make it to the shop, you can stream the entire session via the Turntable Lab Facebook page. /  / ==== /  / Gilles Peterson is a broadcaster, DJ and record collector who’s played a pivotal role in supporting forward-thinking underground music in the UK and beyond over the past three decades. He hosts weekly primetime Saturday afternoon show on BBC Radio 6 Music that’s one of the broadcaster’s most popular music shows, helms independent record label Brownswood Recordings, and is the founder of online radio station Worldwide FM. Throughout his career, Peterson has promoted the new frontiers of jazz, hip-hop, and electronic music. He has been behind several game-changing record labels. Firstly, he founded Acid Jazz Records in the late eighties, and later he started Talkin' Loud, whose roster included Incognito, Galliano, Young Disciples, Courtney Pine, MJ Cole, Terry Callier, The Roots, 4hero, Nuyorican Soul, Carl Craig’s Innerzone Orchestra and Roni Size's Reprazent project. Five of the albums on Talkin Loud were nominated for a Mercury Prize, with Reprazent’s New Forms winning in 1997. His current venture, Brownswood Recordings, was formed in 2006 and has released Ghostpoet’s Mercury Prize-nominated debut album and the 2018 We Out Here project, a celebrated compilation showcasing the UK’s thriving young jazz scene. As a curator and collector, he’s compiled over 100 albums. /  / ==== /  / As one the most important tastemakers Europe has to offer, and affiliated with labels Brownswood, Blue Note, !K7 Records, Stones Throw and Jazzy Sport, LEFTO is consistently a couple steps ahead of your average early adopter. Firmly rooted in jazz and hip hop, he sharpened his digging sensibility working at the now legendary Music Mania record store in hometown Brussels. His passion for jazz resulted in a remix album for Blue Note which was well received by the community. Lefto is forever moving forward but always has an ear in the past. Famed for his gloriously eclectic DJ sets, he switches effortlessly between hip hop, funk, breaks, neck-snapping beats, future bass, South-American influences, bruk riddims and some wild African rhythms. World renowned, LeFtO regularly blesses sound systems from Tokyo to Seoul and Singapore to New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. He has been a resident deejay for Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Festivals since 2008 around the world.  /  / ==== /  / Brownswood Recordings is the independent record label founded by DJ, record collector and broadcaster Gilles Peterson. Founded in 2006, it’s a platform for new artists to grow, and a space for established acts to break with tradition. An outlet for the eclectic breadths of Gilles’ taste as a DJ and collector, its early output broached new orchestral arrangements, full-throttle Japanese jazz and club-rooted soul music. Over a decade later, that inclusive attitude continues. Its output spans the new jazz messengers of the UK underground, fresh tangents in hip-hop-tipped-beatmaking, and snapshots of Havana's burgeoning club culture.","('40.7308591', '-73.9899409660737')"

As a driving force behind the emergence of dub techno, he is widely considered as pivotal in the progression of electronic music since the early 90s. At ISSUE, he presents a new live show entitled Akklamation, a performative compositional cosmos that sets out to unify the expansive and divergent musical paths of the electronics master. From his origins in the German new wave, to his pioneering work in the intersection of dub and various strands of electronic music, to his more recent forays into the fringes of experimental music and composition, Akklamation serves as an investigation into the future of rhythmic structures, timbral architecture, and an exploration of the psycho-physical effects of repetition. /  / 2017 ISSUE Artist-In-Residence Antenes (Lori Napoleon) returns to ISSUE to present a new iteration of her ongoing exploration of material from the NOKIA Bell Labs Archives -- a research process that has run parallel to her practice of appropriating antique and/or otherwise obsolete objects in ways that reference and extend their original functionality. Further refining, processing, and spatializing this material, Napoleon combines synthesis with binaural recordings of Bell Labs artifacts from telecommunications history paired with microscopic sounds produced by personal objects from her life (shells, wires, rocks, old watches, etc.) recorded within the famed The Murray Hill anechoic chamber, the world's oldest wedge-based anechoic chamber built in 1940. Notably, she also uses hand-made equipment built during her residency, including a switchboard that electronically controls 90's flip phone motors Napoleon salvaged -- creating organically unfolding rhythms, drones and resonances within these items, including a replica of the first liquid transmission telephone. /  / American composer Britton Powell presents “If Anything Is,” a new work exploring themes of hyper-reality and ambient capitalism through a mixed-media environment designed for sound and multichannel video. Filmed and recorded over the course of 2019 the work explores an ecstatic exchange of experience in the face of a much-accelerated media and commercial world. A meditation on the intersection of technology, ritual, and urban landscape, the work draws a map through scenes filmed in New York City and points the audience towards the collision at this crossing.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

Growing up in the 90s, Heather developed an early passion for music through genres ranging from Freestyle & house music, to now specializing in house tech, house minimal and deep tech. However, it is the syncopated baselines and instrumental chords of disco that have been most influential to Heather’s music career. Stemming from her childhood, Heather was introduced to disco at a very young age by her parents. Heather’s upbringing acted as a precursor for her trained ear and ability to accent and scale sounds into well blended compositions. With the reemergent of disco samples into more underground channels of music, Heather is passionate about making people appreciate the manifestation of different sounds that they weren’t expecting to hear. “Good djs play what you want to hear, Great djs play the songs you didn’t know you wanted to hear.” / Our Happy Hour from 4pm-10pm , NO COVER! / 21+ event","('40.729917', '-73.9818905444631')"

Both artists chart critical new contexts at the intersection of fragmented narrative, sound design, pop music, song, and experimental composition. /  / Self-taught and independent in its vision and approach, Just The Right Height is an investigation of pop lyricism and idiosyncratic songwriting. Focusing on rhythm stripped of melody, repetition, detailed arrangements, and unique sound sources as her dominant compositional techniques, Hunt intersperses her catalogue with heartfelt, melodic tracks. At ISSUE, she performs songs from her last two albums, Let Forever Be Only You Tonight, released last year on 2018 ISSUE Artist-In-Residence James K’s She Rocks! label, and POST​-​FERGIE WHITE CHRISTMAS, released on Nick Klein & Miguel Alvariño’s Primitive Languages imprint. She will also perform new work from an as-yet unannounced upcoming album. Previously, Hunt has used online lyric generators that algorithmically recombined lyrics from existing pop songs as the starting point for many of her hybrid narratives, in her words “creating songs that are original while being reminiscent of previously expressed words and sentiments [...] intended to be overused and uncanny [...] something I notice in my favorite songs.” An inspired combination of noise, fashion, homemade and lo-fi aesthetics, folk, and pop music, the project is an at-times unhinged presentation of highly original songcraft. /  / Daffy Scanlan’s work has long drawn on the lines between electronic and organic sonics. Composing climatic melodies scaled up to expansive, affecting vistas, Scanlan combines heavily processed vocals and poetic storytelling -- exploring fragmented collage and pop stylings in equal measure. A skilled pianist as a child, she worked between analog gear and Fruity Loops throughout her youth, releasing harsh noise and power electronics on a string of labels. But it was after her suitcase was stolen in 2017, containing almost all of her music equipment that Scanlan dove deep into FL Studio, turning a trying moment into an opportunity for deep sonic exploration of the software. The result were compositions with extensive nuance, accents, and details all flecked with digital detritus and swirling waves of echo -- hovering between emotional meltdown and resilience. In 2018, Scanlan released her debut album Revenge Body as Drumloop via Sweat Equity. She continues to self-release tracks through SoundCloud. /  / Keke Hunt is an interdisciplinary artist based in New York. Hunt has performed and released music solo electronic music under various monikers including Just the Right Height since 2014. She has toured with acts such as Odwalla88, Sapphogeist, and Via App. She has releases on Primitive Languages and ALL GONE tapes and SheRocks! Hunt’s earliest music was released as You Nori and collaboration with Marisa Takal. She has also collaborated with Multimedia artist Bryan Edward Collins on a project called Hard World Fashion. She is currently working on her 3rd album and working as a tattoo artist. /  / Daffy Scanlan is an artist from New Jersey, who is currently based in New York City. Her work explores the transportation of objects / language through time and space, channeling their degeneration and disembodiment. She combines cracked and broken textures with dinged color stories, creating portals into a canon of abuse and trauma. Her compositions resemble cornucopias of disintegrating figures, like glowing bunches of archaic characters. She believes disappearing is equal to omnipresence.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

Miki Beach Camp will return to Burning Man in 2020, and whether you're already part of the MikiMau family or are new to our vibe, we'd love your support as we work to spread good times and good music, on and off the playa!  /  / SAVE THE DATE: Saturday - January 25, 2020 /  / ::: About MikiMau ::: /  / MikiMau started from the simplest of concepts – good people sharing a common love. The group is diverse; members hail from different countries, live in different cities, and work in a range of industries. But through this eclectic community runs one intense bond: Love of House Music. / ​ / If Miki Mau was a baby, then it was conceived in Ibiza 2013. A casual group of friends gathered to revel in some of the best house music in the world, and within a few days, the once loosely-knit group found themselves transformed into a tight family — one that continued to dance its way through Winter Music Conference, Burning Man, and countless parties.  /  / With each new adventure — combined with the inspiration to explore, create, and share new beats with one another — the group grew larger. Soon sets were being composed on weekends; speakers and turntables were purchased; and DJ nicknames began to emerge... Alas, MikiMau was born. /  / The term “Mickey Mouse” is at times used to refer to something substandard, or poorly executed and/or organized. As the group gained momentum in their musical efforts, they adopted this label as ""MikiMau"" — giving it a Cuban spin to pay homage to the background of a few founding members. Proving the group’s aspiration is not stardom or profit, but to create music for friends by friends. And to always have fun! /  / 21+ /  / This event is fully supported by the ebb + flow family! / www.ebbandflowmusic.com /  / www.mikimaumusic.com / www.facebook.com/mikimaumusic / www.soundcloud.com/mikimaumusic / www.instagram.com/mikimaumusic / www.instagram.com/kimonodisco","('40.7107222121212', '-73.9272022121212')"

As the co-founder of Downwards, he played an instrumental role in developing the Birmingham techno sound. Growing out of Jeff Mills’ and Robert Hood’s more extreme minimal explorations, Regis’ earliest recordings were landmarks in brutalist industrial hypnosis. In collaboration with Surgeon as British Murder Boys and with Function, Silent Servant & Female in the Sandwell District collective, releases like “Learn Your Lesson” and “Feed Forward” set the bar for modern techno, influence a generation of artists with their combinations of thundering kicks and mercurial, mesmerizing sound design. /  / ◾️ FIEDEL ◾️ Fiedel has been something of a dark horse in electronic music, releasing landmark EPs, helming a residency at Berghain and cultivating a long-running relationship with the seminal Wax Treatment crew. Yet his sound remains surprising and fresh, shirking the expected muscle flexing of those associations for a lighter touch. Where his peers often go big, Fiedel goes weird. His grooves have a spring, his synths a glooby effervescence. That’s not a slight; his bright, unvarnished pallette kills - tracks like “Andreas” or any of his collabs with Errorsmith as MMM make quick work of the dancefloor. Last year he showcased his approach to DJing on the “Berghain 08” mix. In typical fashion, he skipped the studio and went straight to the club, recording it in the heat of the moment. /  / ◾️ NE/RE/A ◾️ Part of BK’s new wave of heavy, no-holds-barred DJs, Basque DJ & Distrikt1 founder Ne/Re/Ea bangs out heaving, saturated techno, EBM etc with a punk spirit. Her work was recently celebrated by Columbian DJ Juliana, who curated “Austral,” a compilation of Latin women in electronic music, released by the NOTT collective.","('40.7152945', '-73.9136973')"

Founded by Yiyang Cao and George de Moura in 2018, Funneled Smoke has since presented work from both established and under-represented artists in underground spaces across Brooklyn and recently contributed live video installations for Interzone Festival and Unsound (NYC). For this event they will be installing an immersive 3-channel rear projection rig with live video and large scale paintings. /  / Vito Ricci is a composer from the 1980’s downtown New York scene whose work was revived in 2015 with a retrospective double LP on the Belgian label Music From Memory. Vito has been composing work for decades working in genres that include punk, modern classical, jazz, and ambient electronic and has created scores for theatre and modern dance productions. Some of his collaborations have included work with Rashied Ali, Peter Zummo, Byard Lancaster, Blue Gene Tyranny, and the Flux Quartet. He will perform alongside Lise Vachon, singer-songwriter born and raised in Montreal. She spent years in New Orleans singing jazz and contemporary music. A resident of New York City for many years, she has been performing with Vito Ricci. Vocalise is her latest recording, produced by Ricci. The two perform an electronic meditation on “the world we are leaving our children.” /  / Philadelphia-based experimental duo Pontiac Streator & Ulla Straus also present new work. Having recently released full-length LP 11 Items and their debut collaborative release Chat on Huerco S.’s West Mineral Ltd imprint, the duo demonstrate a highly-developed sensibility for producing ambient interzones that transmute fleeting, everyday feels into ephemeral and organically unresolved compositions. Their recent work reveals a greater variegation of their overgrown, verdant electronics -- an ambiguous style that has become key to West Mineral Ltd.'s aesthetic. The music is neither gloomy nor ecstatic but full of transitory sensations somewhere in between those poles -- pulled in multiple directions at once, resulting in a sublime schism between true experimentalism and heavy-rhythm. /  / Yiyang Cao (b. 1991, China) is a Brooklyn-based multi-disciplinary artist and designer born and raised in Hangzhou, China. She received her BFA in Film/Animation/Video at Rhode Island School of Design. Through moving image, participatory sculptural environments, and live video performances, Yiyang’s work investigates the rhetorics of time in new media; exploring the cross-pollination between out-of-screen and in-screen time, she attempts to provoke dimensional thought on perception and our collective states of being. She utilizes a wide range of video sources in her work including analog modular synthesizers, computer-based generative programs, recorded camera footage, and motion-graphics. She has exhibited and performed in US, Japan, Mexico, Germany, Netherlands and Denmark. /  / George de Moura (b. 1986, New York City) is a Columbian-American artist working in painting, animation, and experimental electronic music. de Moura’s painting explores figuration in dark environments, drawing parallels between the work of Caravaggio and contemporary nightlife culture. As a musician under the moniker “Serpent in a Straight Line” de Moura uses synthesizers, field recordings, turntables, and computer software to create work that draws influence from avant-garde tape music, cyberpunk, and left-field techno. He is a frequent collaborator of the feminist performance artist Narcissister and has performed at spaces such Studio for Art and Architecture, Envoy Enterprises. He was a 2017 resident at EMS in Stockholm, and was included in A.L. Steiner’s collaborative installation in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. /  / Vito Ricci's leading edge instinct and creativity have made him a vital and prolific composer of illuminating and compelling works. Infused with poignancy and honesty, his music has the power to linger in the listener's memory. An artist who has been called "" composer of wide ranging and obsessively fascinating collection of works"" by the Wire, and his soundtracks compared to ""heirloom seeds put back in circulation"" by Pitchfork and ""elegant and snappy"" by the New York Times. Vito Ricci has been on the leading edge of the downtown music scene since 1979. During his thirty-year-plus career, Mr. Ricci has scored over fifty productions including concert music, theater, dance, performance, film and video. His collaborative works include partnerships with Bob Holman, Martin Goldray, Rashied Ali, Flux Quartet, Jacob Burkhardt, Lise Vachon, and The Wooster Group. Performances of his works have been presented at The Skyball Theater, The Public Theater, La MaMa Theater, Greenwich Music House, Cooper Union, Roulette, The Knitting Factory, St. Marks Church, The Performing Garage, the Walker Arts Center and the Southern Theater, both in Minneapolis. Recent accomplishments include a performance at MOMA/PS1 with Bob Holman in November 2017, one with Lise Vachon at Pacific Rhythm in Vancouver in August 2017, a residency at Sisters, Brooklyn in 2016 with Lise Vachon, a performance at ISSUE, August 2015 with Lise and the late Steve Dalachinsky, scoring ""Philosophies"" for the Complexions Contemporary Ballet who went on to tour the world in 2007. Recent recordings are ""My Little Life"", a book/cassette published by séance-centre in 2017, ""Symphony for Amiga "", a vinyl commissioned by Intelligent Instruments in 2016, a double vinyl, ""I was Crossing a Bridge"", a collection of his works by Music from Memory in 2015, the recording of a CD of his string quartets ""I Don't Know Who I Am"" by the Flux Quartet in 2009, and producing, composing and playing on Lise Vachon's CD ""Vocalise"" in 2006 with stellar musicians, Rashied Ali, Peter Zummo, Byard Lancaster and Blue Gene Tyranny. /  / Lise Vachon was born in Montreal where she grew up singing with her family. She studied piano and oboe. Always interested in songs whether in the French tradition or from other countries and time, Lise was always into the human voice. Her early work with Luc Cousineau, a singer/songwriter with whom she recorded and toured, was followed with an association with the Ville Emard Blues Band. She then created Toubabou with Michel Seguin, a percussionist, playing in concert and recording. She then ventured solo, writing. Always moving further musically and vocally she traveled in South America, the Caribbean Islands, Western Europe, Mali, Senegal, Togo, Ivory Coast, and the American Deep South. During her years in New Orleans, Lise continued her vocal explorations and song writing. She collaborated with new music composers and taught at Loyola University. Currently living in New York City, Lise has been working with Vito Ricci, an American composer and her partner in life. Commitment to exploration, influences, travels and an abiding interest in experimentation has taken her from her early singer/songwriter tradition to art songs, jazz, to contemporary music, electronic ambient, genre crossing to a spontaneous vocabulary of her own.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

Founded by Yiyang Cao and George de Moura in 2018, Funneled Smoke has since presented work from both established and under-represented artists in underground spaces across Brooklyn and recently contributed live video installations for Interzone Festival and Unsound (NYC). For this event they will be installing an immersive 3-channel rear projection rig with live video and large scale paintings. /  / Vito Ricci is a composer from the 1980’s downtown New York scene whose work was revived in 2015 with a retrospective double LP on the Belgian label Music From Memory. Vito has been composing work for decades working in genres that include punk, modern classical, jazz, and ambient electronic and has created scores for theatre and modern dance productions. Some of his collaborations have included work with Rashied Ali, Peter Zummo, Byard Lancaster, Blue Gene Tyranny, and the Flux Quartet. He will perform alongside Lise Vachon, singer-songwriter born and raised in Montreal. She spent years in New Orleans singing jazz and contemporary music. A resident of New York City for many years, she has been performing with Vito Ricci. Vocalise is her latest recording, produced by Ricci. The two perform an electronic meditation on “the world we are leaving our children.” /  / Philadelphia-based experimental duo Pontiac Streator & Ulla Straus also present new work. Having recently released full-length LP 11 Items and their debut collaborative release Chat on Huerco S.’s West Mineral Ltd imprint, the duo demonstrate a highly-developed sensibility for producing ambient interzones that transmute fleeting, everyday feels into ephemeral and organically unresolved compositions. Their recent work reveals a greater variegation of their overgrown, verdant electronics -- an ambiguous style that has become key to West Mineral Ltd.'s aesthetic. The music is neither gloomy nor ecstatic but full of transitory sensations somewhere in between those poles -- pulled in multiple directions at once, resulting in a sublime schism between true experimentalism and heavy-rhythm. /  / Yiyang Cao (b. 1991, China) is a Brooklyn-based multi-disciplinary artist and designer born and raised in Hangzhou, China. She received her BFA in Film/Animation/Video at Rhode Island School of Design. Through moving image, participatory sculptural environments, and live video performances, Yiyang’s work investigates the rhetorics of time in new media; exploring the cross-pollination between out-of-screen and in-screen time, she attempts to provoke dimensional thought on perception and our collective states of being. She utilizes a wide range of video sources in her work including analog modular synthesizers, computer-based generative programs, recorded camera footage, and motion-graphics. She has exhibited and performed in US, Japan, Mexico, Germany, Netherlands and Denmark. /  / George de Moura (b. 1986, New York City) is a Columbian-American artist working in painting, animation, and experimental electronic music. de Moura’s painting explores figuration in dark environments, drawing parallels between the work of Caravaggio and contemporary nightlife culture. As a musician under the moniker “Serpent in a Straight Line” de Moura uses synthesizers, field recordings, turntables, and computer software to create work that draws influence from avant-garde tape music, cyberpunk, and left-field techno. He is a frequent collaborator of the feminist performance artist Narcissister and has performed at spaces such Studio for Art and Architecture, Envoy Enterprises. He was a 2017 resident at EMS in Stockholm, and was included in A.L. Steiner’s collaborative installation in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. /  / Vito Ricci's leading edge instinct and creativity have made him a vital and prolific composer of illuminating and compelling works. Infused with poignancy and honesty, his music has the power to linger in the listener's memory. An artist who has been called "" composer of wide ranging and obsessively fascinating collection of works"" by the Wire, and his soundtracks compared to ""heirloom seeds put back in circulation"" by Pitchfork and ""elegant and snappy"" by the New York Times. Vito Ricci has been on the leading edge of the downtown music scene since 1979. During his thirty-year-plus career, Mr. Ricci has scored over fifty productions including concert music, theater, dance, performance, film and video. His collaborative works include partnerships with Bob Holman, Martin Goldray, Rashied Ali, Flux Quartet, Jacob Burkhardt, Lise Vachon, and The Wooster Group. Performances of his works have been presented at The Skyball Theater, The Public Theater, La MaMa Theater, Greenwich Music House, Cooper Union, Roulette, The Knitting Factory, St. Marks Church, The Performing Garage, the Walker Arts Center and the Southern Theater, both in Minneapolis. Recent accomplishments include a performance at MOMA/PS1 with Bob Holman in November 2017, one with Lise Vachon at Pacific Rhythm in Vancouver in August 2017, a residency at Sisters, Brooklyn in 2016 with Lise Vachon, a performance at ISSUE, August 2015 with Lise and the late Steve Dalachinsky, scoring ""Philosophies"" for the Complexions Contemporary Ballet who went on to tour the world in 2007. Recent recordings are ""My Little Life"", a book/cassette published by séance-centre in 2017, ""Symphony for Amiga "", a vinyl commissioned by Intelligent Instruments in 2016, a double vinyl, ""I was Crossing a Bridge"", a collection of his works by Music from Memory in 2015, the recording of a CD of his string quartets ""I Don't Know Who I Am"" by the Flux Quartet in 2009, and producing, composing and playing on Lise Vachon's CD ""Vocalise"" in 2006 with stellar musicians, Rashied Ali, Peter Zummo, Byard Lancaster and Blue Gene Tyranny. /  / Lise Vachon was born in Montreal where she grew up singing with her family. She studied piano and oboe. Always interested in songs whether in the French tradition or from other countries and time, Lise was always into the human voice. Her early work with Luc Cousineau, a singer/songwriter with whom she recorded and toured, was followed with an association with the Ville Emard Blues Band. She then created Toubabou with Michel Seguin, a percussionist, playing in concert and recording. She then ventured solo, writing. Always moving further musically and vocally she traveled in South America, the Caribbean Islands, Western Europe, Mali, Senegal, Togo, Ivory Coast, and the American Deep South. During her years in New Orleans, Lise continued her vocal explorations and song writing. She collaborated with new music composers and taught at Loyola University. Currently living in New York City, Lise has been working with Vito Ricci, an American composer and her partner in life. Commitment to exploration, influences, travels and an abiding interest in experimentation has taken her from her early singer/songwriter tradition to art songs, jazz, to contemporary music, electronic ambient, genre crossing to a spontaneous vocabulary of her own.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

Compared to her more linear peers, the CLR & Soma artist brings a vital diversity to her sets. Constant rhythmic interplay, bristling flourishes and uncompromising impact give her sets the kind of masterful freshness that can only come through decades behind the decks. Her hybrid sets often combine DJing with live hardware workouts, fusing her excellent production & selector chops.

Gnarly synths and cracking drums are blended with a liquid elegance and dramatic flair.

Recently he’s expanded into live sets, and also brought his ambient work to Berlin Atonal under his own name Shaun Baron-Carvais. “I’m thirsty for discovery” he recently told an interviewer. “I don’t want to put any boundaries on my music, especially in my own productions.” /  / ◾️ GIA ◾️ Brooklyn based artist GIA’s sets at parties like Melting Point up the ante on the city’s recent ride-or-die approach to hardcore rave demoliton.

These works present the concept of the contrabass clarinet as an acoustic synthesizer. By sustaining multiple sounds simultaneously, the clarinet becomes a harmonic tube where sounds interact and create beating harmonics. Through the use of internal microphones, small sounds become more audible, and bass more physical; allowing for a more visceral listening experience. The evening includes premieres of new compositions. /  / Taking cues from electronically-generative musics, spectral music, the ebbing and idling of automotive engines, and years of close study and collaboration with Roscoe Mitchell, McCowen deals with the interactions, fluctuations, and spectral shifts of pitch relationships. This language is commonly executed through circular-breathing as a means to create density and development. However, through solo performance, McCowen attempts to buck the stigma of circular-breathing solo performance as a physical struggle, but rather an embodied focus through the transformation of anxiety. /  / John McCowen is a Brooklyn-based composer and performer originally from Southern Illinois. His work focuses on extending the possibilities of the clarinet & contrabass clarinet. John embraces long-form drones, difference tones, and beating harmonics as a means to extrude the dimensions within - treating the clarinet as an acoustic synthesizer. His discography includes releases on Edition Wandelweiser, International Anthem, Astral Spirits, NNA Tapes, Cairn Desk, and others. Performances include Le Guess Who Festival (Utrecht), Norður og Niður Festival (Reykjavik), Hot Air Music Festival (SF), Bowling Green New Music Festival, Supersonic Festival (Birmingham), Berkeley Art Museum (BAMPFA), The Stone, San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and Constellation (Chicago). John was a 2017 & 2019 artist-in-residence at Lijiang Studio in Yunnan, China. He received the Elizabeth Mills Crothers Award for excellence in music composition in 2016 from Mills College where he also received an MA in Music Composition under the mentorship of Roscoe Mitchell.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

The DEA was formed in 1973, and with it came mandatory prison sentences for non-violent drug-related crimes. It wasn't until the '80s when Ronald Reagan really buckled down on drugs, causing a surge in incarcerations, primarily targeting poor people and people of color.  /  / The War on Drugs still rages on today, though less public and with shifting dynamics. It is widely accepted that the tactics of punishment and stigmatization continue to fail in getting people to stop using drugs. In fact, studies show that they more than likely have the reverse effect, while also causing severe trauma to poor communities of color. The harm reduction movement came about in response to this crisis. Historically, harm reduction is a collection of public health and social practices that communities engage in to care for each other, intending to reduce the social and physical consequences of drug consumption, regardless of legality. The objective is to see where people stand on drug consumption and meet them there by treating them with compassion.  /  / DanceSafe is a public health non-profit advocacy organization for health and safety in electronic music and nightlife communities. Established in 1998 in the San Francisco Bay Area, DanceSafe was formed after its founder, Emanuel Sferios, discovered a problem with contaminated ecstasy floating in the underground rave scene and a lack of knowledge and resources on the use of MDMA. DanceSafe would, therefore, be established on two fundamental operating principles: harm reduction and peer-based, accessible education. The integration of these two principles has empowered the organization to develop effective peer-based education initiatives to reduce drug addiction and empower young people to make safe, educated lifestyle choices.  /  / Rave Scout Cookies is committed to promoting harm reduction practices, and so for the past year, we have been in the works with DanceSafe National in hopes of expanding on their mission and legacy to different communities and realms out of their collective reach. We are excited to announce our first event, where we join forces to bring on a function filled with informative tips for both ravers and promotors to munch on. /  / SET TIMES AND DANCESAFE NATIONAL NYC PANEL&DISCUSSION: /  / 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM / GAY BAE [ COOKIE SERIES #014: https://soundcloud.com/ravescoutcookies/cookie-series-014-gaybae ] /  / 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM / RAVE SCOUT COOKIES [ https://ravescout.club/ ] / DANCESAFE NATIONAL NYC [ https://dancesafe.org/ ] / DEE DIGGS [ https://soundcloud.com/dee_diggs ] /  / 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM / STARKA [COOKIE SERIES #004: https://soundcloud.com/ravescoutcookies/cookie-series-004-starka ]","('40.69797655', '-73.9279600167073')"

925,2/14/2020,Marcia Bassett with Barry Weisbl,/ Kyle Eyre Clyd,newyork,us,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1378604,20:00 - 22:00,"22 Boerum Place, Brooklyn",$15 - $12,unknown,unknown,"Marcia Bassett with Barry Weisblat, Kyle Eyre Clyd","ISSUE presents artist and musician Marcia Bassett’s Out-SIDe PATtern RE-configuration, a new sound and light performance featuring Bassett’s video projections sourced from digitized super 8mm film, liquid light experiments, and video feedback with color gel slide projections by Barry Weisblat. Kyle Eyre Clyd, the longtime moniker of Alabama-based, interdisciplinary artist Kyle Kessler, also presents new work. In late 2019, Bassett released Kyle Eyre Clyd’s Eggshell on her Yew Recordings imprint. /  / Kyle Eyre Clyd presents new work exploring the figure of the medieval artisan as a figure who is not mad but is becoming-mad and in this half-state of identity, addresses the cosmos. The performance features archaic texts of visionaries accompanied by a de-healing drone whose timbres and transitions induce feelings of nausea and simulate auditory hallucinations. Abstracted close-ups, drag, and vocal pitch shifting in video presentation accompany live manipulation of sound. /  / Throughout her artistic practice, Marcia Bassett has sought to induce trance-like-states of mind through her multifaceted audiovisual work. For Out-SIDe PATtern RE-configuration, Bassett explores the interaction of sound and light and their resulting forms, using analog and digital tools and real-time composition to manipulate and abstract sound into seemingly chaotic and fragmented parts. Interrelations between sound and visual projections unfold in timed sequences organized into areas of duration to further emphasize random relationships, abstractions, and conflict. Her visual presentation expands upon an experimental super 8mm film that she shot, edited and composed a soundtrack for in July 2019 titled “Morning Reflections,” plus slide projections from artist Barry Weisblat. /  / Artist/musician Marcia Bassett works in areas of sound, improvisation, live composition and visual creations. Bassett's work is equal parts trance and critique. Her sound pieces thread the needle between the conceptual and the sensual, between ritual invocation and cold semiotic gaze. Using handmade electronic instruments, prepared guitar, synthesizer, field recordings and tape explorations, Bassett deftly wields philosophical systems to produce heady, experiential clouds; pushing through drones into provocative soundscapes – the intangible narratives of dreams. Bassett frequently performs and tours under her solo moniker Zaïmph. As an improviser and sound artist she also frequently joins others in collaborative installations and multimedia projects. Recent collaborative presentations include work with Ursula Scherrer, OptoSonic Tea a site-specific group improvisation and OptoSonic Echoes an 8-channel continuous sound installation and at The Parrish Museum, Water Mill, NY; ""The Eternal Now"" Buchla Music Easel improvisation with Ted Gordon and colorslide stroboscopic light experiments by Jeffrey Perkins at The Diffusion Festival, Baltimore. D.C.; “Survival Of Laments” a live improvisation with Margarida Garcia and Manuel Mota at Festival Oude Muziek 2018, Utrecht, and guitar and violin improvisations with Samara Lubelski. Marcia Bassett's and Samara Lubelski’s LP ’Morning Flare Symmetries’ will be available in 2020 on Feeding Tube Records. Past collaborations and solo projects include work with Andrew Lafkas’ large ensemble Alternate Models; ""Transitory Freezing of Perpetual Motion"" improvised sound performance with Jenny Graf and dancers at Here-10 Evenings Festival, Sweden; “Field Recording with Zaïmph,” BOMB magazine, and ""Out of Line: Narcissister"" live improvised sound interaction with the performance, High Line, NYC. Additionally, she created an original soundtrack for the 2013, Single Channel Video, ""Ten Ways of Doing Time"", written and directed by James Fotopoulos and Laura Parnes. /  / Kyle Eyre Clyd is the longtime moniker of artist Kyle Kessler, an interdisciplinary artist living and working in Birmingham, AL. She has exhibited and performed at the Contemporary Art Center New Orleans, Sculpture Center (NY), Artist Space (NY), ISSUE Project Room (NY), The Stone (NY), PPOW Gallery (NY) and at numerous experimental music festivals. Her music has been played live on WFMU and on small radio stations worldwide. She holds an MFA in Sound from Bard College and a BFA from the Cooper Union. Her sound work is often the result of collaborations with other musicians and thinkers. She has worked with Keith Connolly, Samara Lubelski, Lea Bertucci, Patrick Cole, Dylan Hay, Anthony Saunders, Peter Bowling, and many more. Her new work is a textual and memorial digression from her time spent performing hundreds of shows in the noise underground and its tangential queer communities. It approaches sound from a contemplative, impressionistic perspective and the plastic arts from a conceptual one. Themes may shift on a project-by-project basis but consistently one feels the influence of semiotic interpretations of art punctuated by a haunted delivery and mystic poeticism.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

Advanced tickets are strongly recommended. /  / For our first events in the new year, Golden Record NYC shifts gears back to the vibe-y, intimate, underground venues where we started, while maintaining our penchant for the epic lineups with equally epic sound and production we’ve become known and respected for. To start our 2020 series off right, we’ve invited Magda and Steve O’Sullivan, two very different, but equally legendary artists in their respective areas. Steve makes a return to Golden Record for a third time, this time with an extra-extended, three-hour presentation of his hypnotically groovy and precise all-hardware live set. We are thrilled to have Magda for an extended set in an intimate setting on our Hennessey Sound Design system for her Golden Record debut. Our resident Morgan will make her first NYC appearance of 2020 with one of the extra-extended opening sets she’s become known and loved for.  /  / Born in Poland and raised in Detroit, Magda has soaked up the various characteristics of her surroundings, resulting in a widely-cultured perspective. In 1998, she was dropped straight into the deep end; she joined Minus and began touring the world as Richie Hawtin's opening DJ.  / Magda's touring schedule is amongst the most high-profile and demanding around, with regular bookings at many of the world's very best house/techno clubs and festivals. She's proved herself as a consistent, adventurous and top-quality performer, with a knack for bringing tracks together in unexpected ways. She’s also frequently seen DJing b2b sets with fellow Detroit OG Mike Servito, a long-time friend whose deep, intense, and diverse style makes a inimitable match for her own. Golden Record welcomes her for the first time for an extended set to let her spread her diverse tastes and deep experience out for all to hear. /  / A veteran of the mid-90s original phase of minimal house and techno, Steve O’Sullivan is renown for his Mosaic label and his classy, dub-based take on techno and house that earned him the respect of peers and critics ever since. Inspired by Basic Channel’s explorations between house, techno, and dub, Steve’s work falls between sub-genres to focus on subtle depth, beauty and groove; his imprint, Mosaic, follows a similarly diverse path, releasing artists whose music evades strict genre divisions and focuses on quality foremost. Following a now-hallowed period from 1995-2003 on Mosaic and elsewhere, 2008 saw a revival of interest in his accomplishments starting on Berlin’s Sushitech, eventually leading to the full-scale relaunch of Mosaic in 2013 with a bevy of releases from both legends and newer names since. Now again touring with live sets that exemplify the kind of depth and attention to detail his career, Golden Record welcomes his return with a special, very extended live PA sure to show off both the subtlety and drive his music is famed for.  /  / A native of Syndey, Australia, Morgan started DJing in the early 2000s. Her style was born from an enduring curiosity about different styles of music beginning at an early age. Starting out as a hip-hop DJ, she quickly and skillfully segued to another percussive, rhythmic style… house music. Her style was shaped by years spent as a resident DJ in Sydney where she played alongside the likes of Moodymann, Nina Kraviz, Carl Craig and Move D, among others. She then relocated to Europe, spending time living in Bucharest and Barcelona, where she once again established herself, this time in the face of world class competition. Making her production debut on Spanish labels Budare and Sunday Money, her collaborations with Guti earned her international notice, eventually landing them on the Martinez Brothers’ Cuttin’ Headz imprint and establishing her sound, a smart blend of classic house with more modern minimal and techno influenced learned in her decade in DJ booths across the globe. Currently based in New York, Morgan quickly became the resident for our Golden Record NYC events, where she has played alongside Fred P, Sammy Dee, Jus-Ed, Losoul, Daniel Bell, Mike Huckaby and Eddie Fowlkes, to name a few. Her range of experience and fluidity behind the decks is never less than a crowd pleaser, whether she’s opening, playing peak hours or closing.",

Join us as we also celebrate the launch of the label, and birthdays of Andhera co-founders Kyle William & Ramsey Neville! /  / Huxley (Toolroom /Knee Deep in Sound/Moon Harbour) /  / It is fair to say that Huxley has fully arrived. Still young but with experiences in the booth and studio well beyond his years, he has a fine array of tools at his disposal. Over the last seven plus years, the friendly character has excelled at many different styles, often ahead of the curve. He does well swung drums as well as bass, main room house and deeper, musically accomplished offerings that stir real emotion. /  / Proof of that lies in his varied and vital discography. Coming on labels like Hypercolour, Tsuba and 20:20 Vision, it includes many club hits and plenty of handy DJ weapons, but also an ambitious and widescreen debut album on Aus Music, which has become a regular home. /  / Always refusing to stay in one sonic niche for too long, Huxley - whether working solo or with close friends like Sam Russo or Ethyl - switches up his sound, tries new things and colours outside the lines with every new outing. Not afraid of a big hook or slaying bassline, he is an artist who unites a variety of sounds, styles and scenes with ease, and always proves as fun as he is well informed. /  / As a DJ, Huxley is someone as comfortable headlining a vast festival stage as he is holding down a small and sweaty basement. He does so from Africa to Australia and is the sort of selector who always delivers a slick, high impact dose of the good stuff. Such is his definitive sense of taste that he continues to lead from the front on his own Rinse FM show. It is there he welcomes exciting guests such as And.ID, Truncate and Vin Sol, and there that you get a wider window into his musical world. /  / The next project on his horizon is No Idea’s Original, an outlet for a wide range of house and techno sounds from Huxley and peers. It has also developed into a party series that has showcased the same sort of fad free, impactful club music that has made Huxley the much loved headline maker he is. /  / www.facebook.com/huxleyofficial/ / www.twitter.com/huxley_music / www.soundcloud.com/huxley_uk","('40.66958775', '-73.9955177593428')"

Come and chill Can’t wait to see you there!  /  / Kevin Saunderson (Origins )  /  / Platinum-selling recording artist, label boss, festival promoter, true innovator in the pantheon of popular music, cultural champion, cracking DJ: there’s a lot to be said about Kevin Saunderson. /  / His influence runs deep, through both adopted hometown of Detroit, and music culture as a whole: as one of the Belleville Three, the high school trio which also includes Juan Atkins and Derrick May, he irreparably changed the face of electronic music; with Inner City, he gave it some of its most memorable tunes.The genesis of today’s enormous techno scene can be retraced straight to Kevin, Derrick and Juan, as their formative experiments on rudimentary hardware sketched a blueprint for a genre that was yet to exist. By absorbing Kraftwerk, cutting-edge funk, local radio stalwart The Electrifying Mojo’s electicism, and all manner of new synthesiser and drum machine-led pop music, the Belleville Three broke new ground as musicians and DJs in the 80s. /  / Saunderson’s comparatively late start as a producer – kicking off in ’87 under the moniker of Kreem, with E-Dancer and Reese two of the more well-known names to follow – inadvertently gifted him a headstart. With the eruption of house music a few hours down the I-94 in Chicago, Saunderson married Detroit’s raw sound to more tactile, pop-leaning sensibilities. Inner City was born, and global success followed.Between “Big Fun”, “Good Life”, debut album Paradise and a number of follow-up singles, Inner City (Saunderson and vocalist Paris Grey) amassed 12 UK top 40 hits and over six million records sold worldwide during their peak. A dancefloor-dominating remix by Luciano in 2008, and a globetrotting reunion tour in 2012, underscores the longevity of Inner City’s classic sound.His nickname of ‘The Elevator’ is apt: for his role in transporting Detroit’s new sound to a wider audience; as anyone who has seen him perform live can attest, his high-energy, high-spirit and high-impact DJ sets; and for spending the past 35 years of his life progressing the culture he helped create.Operating in tandem to his golden run as a producer in the late 80s and early 90s, Saunderson’s own KMS record label – a remarkable 30 years strong in 2017 – has chronicled the early footsteps of R-Tyme, Blake Baxter, MK, Chez Damier, Derrick Carter, Bicep and even Saunderson’s son and regular DJ partner Dantiez more recently. /  / A special 12” series in 2008 called History Elevate, released in tandem with fellow polymath Carl Craig’s Planet E label, brought contemporary names like Mathew Jonson, Simian Mobile Disco and Loco Dice into the fold, proving his nous for fostering relationships with each new wave to come through techno’s gates. 25th anniversary compilations and numerous reissues have followed suit.Saunderson has a behind-the-scenes role to play, too: he is intertwined with the history of Detroit’s flagship Movement (formerly Detroit Electronic Music Festival / Fuse-In). Having produced the event in the mid-2000s, the last handful of years have seen repeated invites from Movement to display his ORIGINS showcase at the festival, bringing acts like Delano Smith, Phuture and DJ Minx under his curatorial umbrella.And of course, with a stacked international touring schedule over the decades, playing in nearly every country and at nearly every festival or club worth mention, he has not stopped pushing the feeling of techno on and on. /  / The Groove That Won’t Stop, indeed. /  / Thugfucker (Life and Death) (VisionQuest )(Music for Freaks) /  / Former international aid worker teams up with Icelandic security specialist and former top model to create an international DJ supergroup. Certainly not what you’d expect from a group called Thugfucker – but then Thugfucker has always managed to defy expectations. /  / One a New Yorker transplanted to Europe, the other an Icelander transplanted to New York. Both from a strong musical background with an almost obsessive dedication to the art of wild party instigation. /  / Growing up on an Icelandic commune full of some of the country’s finest political thinkers, Holmar eschewed his past and all the heady philosophy of his childhood to move to New York and search out more physical and visceral methods of bringing happiness to the masses. /  / Meanwhile Greg was in the midst of a successful (if short-lived) political career in America when he too became disillusioned with the duplicity and self serving interest of those around him. Disturbed by the void he saw in most people’s lives, it was in the dark depths of the New York underground club scene that he finally found his true calling. /  / Unbeknownst to each other, Greg and Holmar then propelled themselves along similar paths, throwing parties, honing their musical & studio skills and searching out inspiration from a wide variety of musical sources. /  / Then one late night, in a cloudy alcohol fueled discussion about the plight of the genetically Rhythm-Blind, Greg and Holmar recognized the depth of their shared passions. Thugfucker was born. /  / When Thugfucker’s single, “Disco Gnome” was released in 2011 it marked the beginning of the highly respected Life and Death label (which Greg co-founded alongside Matteo Milleri and Manfredi Romano) and very quickly, lots of little gnomes were found in the boxes of some of the best DJs worldwide. /  / Disco Gnome received widespread play in all kinds of clubs around the world from DJs as varied as Seth Troxler & the Visionquest crew, Jamie Jones, Guy Gerber, Loco Dice, Sasha, Pete Tong and many many many more. It remains to this day a favorite of clubbers worldwide. /  / Following this came another collaboration with friends and label mates Tale of Us, this time in the form of an EP for Visionquest. With two tracks, “Morgana” and “Step Aside” (featuring Scott McCloud of Girls Against Boys), this collaboration also got lots of love from DJ’s everywhere, went #1 on Beatport, not to mention being named an ‘essential’ track by Pete Tong on his Radio 1 show. /  / And in the meantime Thugfucker continued traveling the globe playing extended back to back DJ sets at some of the best clubs and parties worldwide. From Burning Man to Panorama Bar to Fabric to BPM and Sonar and Coachella to DC10 and Output and Katerholzig and many more. If you haven’t partied with Thugfucker yet then you probably haven’t been trying hard enough to have a good time. /  / Ever evolving, in 2018 Thugfucker saw Holmar departing from the project to pursue other endeavors while Greg continues to keep the Thugfucker fire burning bright as he steers the project upwards and onwards into the future. /  / Thugfucker is currently splitting time between working on new music in the studio and continued traveling and touring worldwide.","('40.708464', '-73.938172')"

Minimal but on-edge, dubby but snarling, unhurried but leading the charge - once you’ve found your way into Vincent’s music, you won’t want to leave. 2019 was as busy a year as ever for him, with shows across Europe, the US and Asia and a standout new album “World Order Music,” which saw him exploring a palette of classic ‘90s NY rave sounds as only he can.  /  / ◾️ TIN MAN ◾️ There’s acid and then there’s Tin Man. Since his debut release “Places” in 2004, Johannes Auvinen has used the Tin Man moniker to explore the Roland 303 with the depth and patience of a painter. In his hands, the squiggly mono sequences of the iconic instrument become invocations of the sublime, his tracks imbued with a monastic focus. His most recent releases on Konstruct, Acid Test and Global A stand as confirmations of his ascetic devotion to the genre. Countless producers play around with squelchy basslines; Tin Man lives it. /  / ◾️ JUSTIN CUDMORE ◾️ Bunker NY bad boy Justin Cudmore is on a tear. Following the release of the snaky club monster “Are You Ready,” he announced Balance, a new residency at Basement, played an uninterrupted slew of sets from Panorama Bar to Mumbai, India and established himself as one of NY’s most in-demand selectors. His recent appearance on Beats in Space shows him in top form, fluently weaving italo synths, jacked up house and humid techno.","('40.7152945', '-73.9136973')"

Written for and performed by cellist Charles Curtis and wind ensemble, the piece is staged featuring new choreography from Abigail Levine. The piece is based on a particular sonority, that has haunted Lucier for decades, from the first movement of Igor Stravinsky’s ballet score, Orpheus. The evening also features Lucier’s Glacier for solo cello, also performed by Curtis. /  / Orpheus Variations is one of eight large-scale compositions made expressly for Charles Curtis by Alvin Lucier in the last 15 years. Curtis notes, “Lucier speaks first of a sonority, and only then of a chord. He discusses the chord, its notes and their disposition, but what haunts him is a 'particular sonority.' A sonority is the product of physical action on physical materials: the instruments, the registers in which they are activated, the breath of the musicians, the waveforms thus produced, their merging and interfering, and finally the moment and place of these actions. An energy field, certain to vanish completely once the musicians put down their instruments. However concrete and real the actions and materials, the sonority they produce is a phantom.” /  / In Orpheus Variations, Alvin Lucier arranges the pitches from a single chord of Stravinsky’s Orpheus, itself created as the score for a ballet. The chord is distributed across eight instrumental voices -- seven winds and cello -- who cycle through the pitches, meeting each other in moments of unison and counterpoint. Abigail Levine’s choreography for Orpheus Variations transposes Lucier’s score from sound to gesture. Performed by seven dancers, the choreography is composed with a closed set of seven gestures, which reflect the position, doubling, and progression of the pitches of Stravinsky’s chord. The dancers of the work become, fleetingly, an incarnation of this spectral sound. /  / Abigail Levine has organized an intergenerational group of dancers including Rob Besserer, Elena Demyanenko, Kentoria Earle, Ayano Elson, Maho Ogawa, and Kristopher K.Q. Pourzal. /  / The wind ensemble features students from the University of San Diego under the direction of Charles Curtis: Rachel Allen, Teresa Diaz de Cossio, Nicolee Kuester, Mike Lormand, Michael Matsuno, Alexandria Smith, and Berk Schneider. /  / Written in 2009, Glacier features a cellist slowly sweeping downward, tracking a graph of the mean mass balance of 30 glaciers over a 24-year period, from 1980 to 2004. Glacier was commissioned by Feet to the Fire, Exploring Global Climate Changes from Science to Art and has recently been performed by Curtis with the The Society For The Activation of Social Space Through Art and Sound in Los Angeles, and Lampo in Chicago. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mark Swed describes Glacier as “A quiet piece and a sad one [but also] extremely delicate and endearingly lovely one.” /  / The program observes Lucier’s delicate and lyrical compositional legacy and his enduring engagement with the elusive characteristics of how sound materializes -- with how acoustic mechanics are rediscovered, considered, and performed. Lucier has pioneered many areas of music composition and performance, including the notation of performers' physical gestures, the use of brain waves in live performance, the generation of visual imagery by sound in vibrating media, and the evocation of room acoustics for musical purposes. His sensitivity to sound as a physical phenomenon and his attention to rich aural experience is often practiced through tactical, research-oriented strategies dedicated to contextual listening. A vital figure within experimental music, the compositions of Lucier highlight a general theory of sound, one suggestive of our entangled perceptual position in the sonic world, as well as our attempts to hear the yet-to-be heard. /  / Since the mid-1960s, Alvin Lucier has produced a range of important compositions that have influenced the culture of experimental music and the sonic arts. Early works such as Music for Solo Performer (1965), Vespers (1968), I am sitting in a room (1970), and Bird and Person Dyning (1975) establish a clear thread throughout his long career. Lucier was born in 1931 in Nashua, New Hampshire. He was educated in Nashua public and parochial schools, the Portsmouth Abbey School, Yale, and Brandeis and spent two years in Rome on a Fulbright Scholarship. From 1962 to 1970 he taught at Brandeis, where he conducted the Brandeis University Chamber Chorus, which devoted much of its time to the performance of new music. In 1966, along with Robert Ashley, David Behrman and Gordon Mumma, he co-founded the Sonic Arts Union. From 1968 to 2011 he taught at Wesleyan University where he was John Spencer Camp Professor of Music. Lucier lectures and performs extensively in Asia, Europe and The United States. Recently, Alvin Lucier was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States and received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Plymouth, England. Lucier's compositions have been recently featured at ISSUE Project Room including in a two-night retrospective in 2017 and as part of the Sonic Arts Union celebration in 2018*. Lucier was honored at ISSUE's 2018 Gala for his exceptional leadership in the experimental arts communit /  / Called by ArtForum ""one of the great cellists"" as well as ""spellbinding and minimal,"" Charles Curtis has woven a unique career through the worlds of classical performance and musical experimentation. A student of Harvey Shapiro and Leonard Rose at Juilliard and the recipient of the Piatigorsky Prize, upon graduation Curtis was appointed to the faculty of Princeton University. Subsequently he was Principal Cellist of the NDR Symphony Orchestra in Hamburg, where he appeared as soloist with conductors such as Herbert Blomstedt, André Previn, Günter Wand, John Eliot Gardiner and Christoph Eschenbach. Curtis has been guest soloist with the San Francisco Symphony, Baltimore Symphony, National Symphony, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Janacek Philharmonic, Orquestra de la Maggio Musicale Florence, and orchestras in Brazil and Chile, among many others. For more than twenty years Curtis has been closely associated with the legendary avant garde composer La Monte Young. As soloist and as director of Young's Theatre of Eternal Music String Ensemble, Curtis has participated in more performances and premieres of Young's music than any other musician. In the last few years Curtis has developed a unique repertoire of major works created expressly for the distinctive qualities of his cello-playing. The great American experimental composer Alvin Lucier has composed numerous works for Curtis, including pieces for cello and sine waves, cello and piano, and cello with large orchestra. French composer Eliane Radigue created her very first work for a purely acoustic instrument for Curtis, the hour-long solo ""Naldjorlak I,"" which Curtis has performed scores of times throughout the world; more recently ""Naldjorlak III"" and ""Occam 5"" have been developed collaboratively with Curtis. Artist and performer Alison Knowles created a unique graphic score for Curtis which has been realized in galleries and alternative settings. These, along with the monumental works of La Monte Young and rarely-heard pieces by Terry Jennings, Richard Maxfield and Morton Feldman, have been championed by Curtis through regular performances and recordings. /  / Abigail Levine is an artist working between New York and Los Angeles.

Techno, house and Afrobeat had as much of a place on the dancefloor as jazz, Brazilian and the words of great poets.

Like Peter Brötzmann and Han Bennink’s Schwarzwaldfahrt before them, Shots teeter, precariously, on a ledge between environmental and performed sound, but with a sincere carelessness and deliberate ineptitude more deeply rooted in hardcore than the bleached fossils of virtuosic improvisation. The intrusion of the field into their elemental recordings translates, in the live arena, to site-specific considerations that include choreographed movement, concealed microphones, and dripping junk as vehicles for their signature sleight of hand and meditative slapstick. /  / Organized by Adrian Rew, Curatorial Assistant & Marketing, Blank Forms.","('34.0606108', '-118.2438652')"

As one third of Hessle Audio (alongside Ben UFO and Pearson Sound), he’s helmed one of the most groundbreaking labels of the era. Hessle shepherded dubstep from its initial turn-of-the-millennium bass bin bleakness into a more startling, cross pollinated sound that splintered across the globe. As Pangaea, McAuley has been an engine of constant reinvention. His earliest releases were some of Hessle’s strongest, reveling in dank atmospherics and a classically-UK sense of longing. Since then, he’s embraced techno’s momentum, minimal’s grooviness, and IDM’s bubbling sense of discovery. 2014’s FABRICLIVE.73 plays with rhythm with an effortless fluency, a masterclass in percussive contrast and cohesion. More recently, tracks like “Cuba Vox” on his own Hadal imprint strip back the fanfare for some breezy rolling. More than ten years after his debut, Pangaea’s explorations refuse to slow down.  /  / ◾️ GALCHER LUSTWERK ◾️ It’s only been six years since Galcher Lustwerk released his “100% Galcher” mix, but its timeless aura of laconic cool and breezy seduction made it an instant classic. Presented by the relatively unknown Blowing Up The Workshop, its 146,000 plays to date dwarf the rest of the series. Lustwerk’s music is a quiet game changer: though he’s influenced many of house music’s most popular young producers, he remains inimitable. There’s a profound sense of mystery behind the simple-but-deadly arrangements and barely-there vocal hooks. This spaciousness gives Lustwerk no place to hide. Nonetheless, you find yourself leaning into the empty pockets in the mix, searching for something. His widely-hailed third LP “Information” was released this past fall on Ghostly International. The album finds Lustwerk in a less idyllic mood, honing his blunted sound into something with a sharper edge, yet his uncanny ability to melt time remains intact. /  / ◾️ LAUREN FLAX ◾️ Detroit native and NY mainstay Lauren Flax’s career moves with a remarkable fluidity. Her trip hop group CREEP made a strong impression at the start of the decade, releasing on Young Turks and producing tracks with Tricky, while as a solo artist she ran the gamut from pop collaborations with Sia to anthemic house anthems alongside MK. More recently, Flax has been exploring metallic hardware workouts and Chicago-style beatdowns for the Bunker NY. Her DJ sets trade in classic Midwest electroid funk and more steely, teutonic techno.","('40.7152945', '-73.9136973')"

Saturday Feb 29 Boris makes his debut at 260 Meserole Street, Brooklyn.  /  / This event is powered by Jonpaul Pezzo, Benny Soto and Nervous Records.  /  / For Table inquiries, email [email protected]  /  / BIO / It’s all about the music. New York stalwart and beloved DJ, Boris, lives by that statement each and every day. He is a man wearing many hats; one as a touring DJ, another as a producer dynamo and lastly as a label boss of Transmit Recordings. A career forged over decades of long nights in the Big Apple’s most revered rooms. From the infamous Roxy to Crobar to the once dominating Pacha NY on 46th Street, Boris maintained a following so devout, so loyal they were truly ‘Believers’. Pioneering a music movement in a city filled with those who have so little time to pay attention, Boris has been a production powerhouse when not performing for the masses. He’s been tapped by industry leaders such as Carl Cox for his label Intec, Dubfire for his label Sci-Tec, Paco Osuna and his Mindshake records, amongst countless others. /  / His ability behind the decks and in the studio has not only made him a New York favorite, but his music has taken him places all around the world ranging from the shores of Playa Del Carmen to the magical White Isle known as Ibiza. Known to many as the ‘DJ’s DJ’, Boris has had the career most DJs can only wish to have. The trends, they may change but the New York native has stayed true to his drum driven sounds and created his own niche in the wide and vast world of electronic music. Taking bits and pieces from every part of the globe he visits, Boris always maintains a piece of home in his music.  /  / Even though his career spans nearly three decades, the journeyman DJ has yet to falter. We currently find him playing leading to destinations across the globe and his music is in high demand with forthcoming releases many sought after labels, Boris will is constantly on the tips of the younger generation’s tounge. Why? Because talent, like wine, gets better with age.","('40.708464', '-73.938172')"

With emotionality at the core of their compositional style, Andrews is known for expansive works which weave voice and instrumental performance into massive cathedrals of sound. Moving between haunting and ethereal, to deafening, cathartic discord, the performance is a visceral response to the consequences of a lack recourse and impact from the torture of patriarchal, white supremicist capitalism. /  / Holland describes, “The first program of the year, Onè, is a long-form vocal and clarinet performance sonically retelling the history of my mother's experience losing her twin children at birth from her own perspective, and a message to them and me and my sister that she was never able to share. The loss of her twins was one of the most instrumental events in her life which lead to her death by suicide in 2008 when I was 16 years old. Within this performance I will be exploring the themes of limitless guilt, loss, and shame, but with a twist. Since the program falls on a day where we can ask ourselves, ‘what could we have done differently to change the course of time?’, the performance is also a reprieve of cathartic nurturing which my mother in this space can now share twins before they died at birth.” /  / Holland Andrews is an American vocalist, composer, improviser, and performance artist whose work is based on emotionality in its many forms. In their work, Andrews focuses on the abstraction of operatic and extended-technique voice to build soundscapes encompassing both catharsis and the interplay between dissonance and resonance to tell stories of the interior worlds of humanity. Frequently highlighting themes surrounding vulnerability and healing, Andrews arranges music with voice and clarinet, harnessing the innate qualities of these instruments’ power and elegance to serve as a vessel for these themes. As a vocalist, their influences stem from a dynamic range of musical stylings including contemporary opera, free jazz, musical theater, as well as ambient, drone, and noise music. In addition to creating solo work, Andrews develops and performs the soundscapes for dance, theater, and film, and whose work is still toured nationally and internationally. Andrews has gained recognition from publications such as The New York Times, Uncut Magazine, Electronic Sound, NPR, and more. Holland Andrews is currently based in New York City. Andrews also performs solo music under the stage name Like a Villain, including a performance at ISSUE alongside Tyondai Braxton in 2017.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

NOMADIC SIGNALS is a vessel for sonic performance operating in what Tawil refers to as the “diasporic imaginary,” a description of how sounds change in the diaspora: how they tether to their environment, accumulate, synthesize, and adapt at each location. /  / The artists Tawil has brought together for the first NOMADIC SIGNALS use composition and improvisation to address origin, inherency, and borders. They are rigorous with their methods; and pointed with their ancestral references and Babylonian propositions. Together under this umbrella, they contextualize one another and obfuscate the “othering” that often surrounds their work. /  / Porest is the outlet of post-American artist and producer Mark Gergis, a London-based Iraqi-American artist originally hailing from Oakland. Mark Gergis is a storyteller of dystopic currents; his shows are radio-like, as he streams between distorted Syrian rhythms, audio samples of otherlands and absurdist commentary. Las Sucias, the Oakland-based duo of Danishta Rivero and Alexandra Buschman-Román, use voice, synths, and live manipulations that shapeshift the room into a femmenoise vortex that accesses their Puerto Rican and Venezuelan spirits. /  / For decades, Porest has issued a trail of confounding agitprop sound art, post-globalized hate-pop, diabolical radio dramas, big songs and small songs. Porest’s blatant embezzlement of human syntax and cultural misunderstanding broadcasts vital mixed messages across all fields, forging carefully rearranged realities that both avoid and indulge the inherent trappings of radical art and politics. Live performances integrate Porest’s music, performance and sound into a grand total sum that can’t be unseen. Porest has performed and toured worldwide, with albums released on Nashazphone (Cairo), Discrepant (UK), and in the US on the Seeland, Abduction and Resipiscent labels. In the 1990s and 2000s, Mark was co-founder of the long-running experimental performance collective Mono Pause, as well as its offshoot Neung Phak. In his other life, Mark is an archivist and producer for global music releases on the Sublime Frequencies and Sham Palace labels, including compilations and documentary works such as I Remember Syria, Cambodian Cassette Archives, Saigon Rock & Soul, Choubi Choubi (Iraq), Dabke: Sounds from the Syrian Houran and his extensive work with artists Omar Souleyman (Syria) and Erikin Koray (Turkey). /  / Tropical Noise Duo Las Sucias is an Experimental Caribbean Cacophony from the hands and lungs of hysterical brujas Danishta Rivero and Alexandra Buschman-Román, from Venezuela and Puerto Rico respectively. Rooted on Santería, Afro-Caribbean and Mestiza consciousness, through hybrid rhythms that include Raggaetón and Cumbia, Las Sucias booty smashes the limits put upon the brown female body by the patriarchy. Through powerful chanting and ritualistic vocal catharsis, they conjure the unapologetic screams of a loca, the deep-voiced lady screaming bible verses in the streets through a broken mic and the wounded voices of the colonized.” - Hildegard Von Bingen /  / Alexandra Buschman-Román is a ground shaking radical Sound Artist, Composer, Vocalist, Percussionist and Improviser from Carolina, Puerto Rico, now based mostly in Oakland, CA. Most of her work has been around de-colonization of Noise music and sound experimentation, deconstruction of the traditional and folk, and the fusion of the old and the new. Her mission is to bridge sounds, cultures, space and time - reconnect the diaspora with the motherland, create spaces for marginalized and colonized artists, and glue communities together, all through sociopolitical radicalization of sound and music spaces. /  / Danishta Rivero is an improviser, performer, and sound artist originally from Venezuela, based in Oakland, California. She explores the artifacts resulting from heavy processing of the voice and their relationship to its acoustic resonating presence. She embodies this relationship to create visceral, sonic rituals. As a soloist, Rivero often performs as Caribay, conjuring the eponymous mountain spirit, whose laments cause avalanches.

Previously both ISSUE Artists-In-Residence, this is the first ever collaborative project between Vida and Yarn/Wire. The evening also features the ISSUE debut of New York based composer Aaron David Ross (ADR), presenting new compositions from his unreleased Filter Failure song cycle, accompanied by self-made animations. /  / Always Already is a text based composition for electronics, voice and ensemble. It is a hypnotic examination of the materiality of language that emphasizes the rhythm of speech through repetition and variation. Composed and performed by Ben Vida with Nina Dante and Yarn/Wire, this new work expands on the compositions for small vocal ensembles which Vida has presented at such venues as the Kitchen and BAM. /  / Always Already is the first of these pieces to include live instrumentalists. Keyboards, marimbas, electronics and voices are braided together to produce a mesmerizing ramble of language and notes. The works abstract narrative was developed out of a dense cyclical text which was inspired by the rhythmical essays of Gertrude Stein, the Gysin/Burroughs cut-up method and the parsing systems of the Conceptual Writers. /  / Following acclaimed releases Deceptionista and Throat on PAN, ADR’s new solo work Filter Failure takes the form of a cinematic song cycle, featuring ten animated tone-poems which showcase ADR not only as a cybernetic singer-songwriter, but also as a 3D-hobbyist animator. The first project to ever feature ADR’s voice and lyrics, each song serves as the basis for a surrealist visual rendering that showcase avatar-driven lip-synced adventure-scenarios guided by ADR’s affect-driven compositional approach. Often maneuvering between multiple genres and contexts, either through his duo project Gatekeeper, or his productions with Ryan Trecartin, Lafawndah, Telfar, and others, ADR is known for a breadth of vision underpinned by a consistently beguiling, skillful production style. In the past, this exploration has existed between monikers; however, with his recent work, it’s between songs or even seconds of time -- all balancing precariously between embracing and rejecting the overwinding digital time-scales and narrative degeneration we endure as 21st century citizen-users. /  / Before the long-awaited renovation of our 22 Boerum theater begins in April, ISSUE presents a special series of events that reflect on the organization’s trajectory as a home for experimental performance. Featuring artists from across our history as well as new projects, these events mark a milestone moment to celebrate in the theater and support ISSUE as we embark on a period of off-site programming. Join us in bringing commissions, premieres, and rare performances to new contexts and spaces throughout New York City. /  / Ben Vida is a composer and artist. In the mid-1990s Vida co-founded the minimalist quartet Town & Country and released solo records under the moniker Bird Show. He has worked with numerous labels including Shelter Press, PAN, Root Strata and Kranky. His work has been featured in Artforum, Modern Painters, The Paris Review, The New York Times, Art Review, Wire Magazine, The Creators Project, WIRED Magazine among others. His pieces have been presented widely in venues such as the Guggenheim, NYC; GRM/INA, France; Centro Pecci in Prato, Italy; STUK in Leuven, Belgium; the MCA, Chicago; The ICA, London; The Kitchen, NYC; Performa Biennial, NYC; EMPAC, Troy, NY; Leap Gallery, Berlin; Lampo, Chicago; Cricoteka Museum, Kraków, Poland; the Sydney Opera House; Museo d’Arte Moderna di Bologna; Borderline Festival, Athens, Greece; the Royal Festival Hall, London and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, NY. Vida teaches in the MFA program in Sonic Arts at Brooklyn College. /  / Yarn/Wire is a New York-based percussion and piano quartet comprised of Ian Antonio, Laura Barger, Russell Greenberg, and Ning Yu. This instrumental combination allows the ensemble flexibility to slip effortlessly between classics of the repertoire and modern works that continue to forge new boundaries.Founded in 2005 while at Stony Brook University, Yarn/Wire is admired for the energy and precision they bring to performances of today's most adventurous music. The results of their collaborative initiatives with genre-bending artists such as Two-Headed Calf, Pete Swanson, and Tristan Perich point towards the emergence of a new and lasting repertoire that is ""spare and strange and very, very new."" (Time Out NY). Yarn/Wire is dedicated to expanding the repertoire written for its instrumentation, through commissions and collaborative initiatives that aim to build a new and lasting body of work. Influenced by its members’ experiences with classical music, avant-garde theatre, and rock music, the ensemble champions a varied and probing repertoire. /  / Soprano/vocalist Nina Dante is a soloist, chamber musician, improviser and composer based in New York City. Musical experimentation and the continual discovery of the voice’s technical ability and emotive power are the inspiring forces behind her work. Hailed for her “amazing performance of vocal versatility by a uniquely gifted young artist” (Chicago Classical Review), Dante has performed at Resonant Bodies Festival, BAM, Lampo, Issue Project Room, Roulette, the Kitchen, National Sawdust, the University of Chicago’s Contempo, Performa, Indexical, Visiones Sonoras, Museo Universitario de Arte Contemporaneo, the Experimental Sound Studio, New Music Miami, the Latino Music Festival, the Frequency Festival, Festival Interfaz, the Poetry Foundation, and the Renaissance Society, among others. /  / Aaron David Ross (ADR) is a composer, producer and artist preoccupied with music’s affective potentiality. In addition to his work as one half of the critically acclaimed Gatekeeper duo and touring as a member of Oneothrix Point Never’s Myriad ensemble, ADR releases solo recordings, hosts an array of ongoing collaborations, composes for film, tv and advertising, and maintains a practice of live performance and sound installation. As a recording artist, Aaron has released music with renowned independent labels PAN (DE), Warp (UK), Hippos in Tanks (US), Kompakt (DE), Merok (UK), Public Information (UK), and Presto (IT). He has performed at many of the world’s premiere concert venues, clubs and festivals, and has been featured and reviewed in publications including The New York Times, NPR, Art Forum, The Guardian, Dazed & Confused, Pitchfork, Art In America, The Fader, Interview, FACT, and many others. His installed collaborative works have been exhibited at biennials, galleries and museums internationally, including at the Whitney Biennial (US), Venice Biennale (IT), Saatchi Gallery Paris (FR), The DeYoung San Fransisco (US), MoMA New York (US), MCA Chicago (US), and more. His original film scores have premiered in globally celebrated festivals and programs including Festival del film Locarno in Switzerland, Berlin Biennale in Germany, Migrating Forms at BAM in New York, Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement in Geneva, and Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York. Originally from Tucson, AZ, Aaron received a BM in composition from Columbia before pursuing an MFA in Sound Art & Music Technology from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

This care is both that which exceptionally distinguishes her practice, and that which has kept it from circulating through many conventional distribution channels. Now, 10 years after Amacher’s passing, her materials have found a permanent home where traces of the complex, elusive “whole” of her oeuvre will, over the next few years, finally become accessible to researchers and to the public. Join us in celebrating this momentous occasion at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts on March 12th. For this special occasion, Bill Dietz & Amy Cimini will present a selection of original archival documents (writings, scores), objects (artworks, audio gear), and sounds (newly digitized audio) — just a small sampling of the collection’s soon to be accessible breadth.  /  / Maryanne Amacher (1938 – 2009) was a composer of large-scale fixed-duration sound installations and a highly original thinker in the areas of perception, sound spatialization, creative intelligence, and aural architecture. She is frequently cited as a pioneer of what has come to be called “sound art,” although her thought and creative practice consistently challenges key assumptions about the capacities and limitations of this nascent genre. Often considered to be a part of a post-Cagean lineage, her work anticipates some of the most important developments in network culture, media arts, acoustic ecology, and sound studies.","('42.7976632', '-73.9527343')"

Intensely ritualistic, the duo’s free drone music originates from a shared interest in ecstatic and spiritual musics. The inimitable Lary 7 performs a live version of his “droney tone” film piece, an unrepeatable sound and light “rewind” piece which borrows from the arcane technological worlds of film, light, and sound mechanisms combined to create a hypnotic environment. /  / For the first time in New York, John Krausbauer and Kaori Suzuki present their free ecstatic durational music for voices, amplified strings, electronics, and bell percussion. High-volume, sustained tones, and stroboscopic lighting build a collective, radiating, ur-drone in exploration of psychotropic sensorial experience. /  / Lary 7’s “droney tone” piece is a hybridization of the worlds of film editing (rewinds) and repurposed light sensor tubes originally intended as synchronizers for photo studio flashbulbs. The technology converts light into very detailed sound textures, functioning as a microscope for sound. The light source is derived from two strobotac laboratory oscillator-driven neon tubes originally designed under contract of Harold Eugene Edgerton, known as “Papa Flash,” the inventor of the modern day strobe in the 1930s. The result of this highly technical unison technologies is quite hypnotic, atmospheric, and, in Lary’s words “pretty hard to describe without seeing-hearing.” /  / Born in Buffalo, New York, Lary 7 is a multimedia artist who coaxes profane, inscrutable sounds and images from various mysterious devices. Eschewing the digital, his work mainly features vintage and forgotten electronic instruments and technologies. In the past he has taken the unique approach of modifying household appliances in order to give them a musical voice. Lary is a co-founder of Plastickville Records and has been a major figure in the New York experimental underground music scene since 1970. He has worked on exceptional musical projects with diverse artists including Jimi Tenor, Jarboe, Foetus, Tony Conrad, Alexander Hacke, Larry Mullins, Dorit Chrysler, Bernhard Gal, Jacob Kirkegaard, Gen Ken Montgomery, and Gordon Monahan. In 2016, ISSUE commissioned Lary 7 to create Owl Movie, his first-ever fixed media film. /  / John Krausbauer is a composer/multi-instrumentalist/artist based in Oakland, CA and co-founder of the Los Angeles publishing label, Besom Presse. A long time purveyor of the ur-drone and trance-psychedelia, his compositional work involves audio transmissions for TOTAL/immersive experience. Transcendence through repetition, duration, alternate tunings, maximum volumes, and stroboscopic lighting. In recent years he has returned to improvisational playing and sought out particular collaborations to further explore his interest in improvisatory music making. He has performed and presented his music across N America, Europe, and Japan in a multitude of settings - from basements, sidewalks, and rock clubs to colleges, churches, and art museums. Over 20 recordings of his have been released on independent labels in the US, Europe, and Japan. His group and solo music can be found on Important, Beta-Lactam Ring, ANTS, Fabrica, Debacle, Autumn, Thin Wrist (upcoming), and a number of other international labels. His current music projects include the Ecstatic Music Band (a 10+ member-collective of strings players); solo music for amplified violin and tape; his collaboration with partner, Kaori Suzuki, with bells, voices, strings, electronics; the Minimalist psych-punk group Night Collectors; his systems-based phase compositions; as well as past and ongoing duo collaborations with Louisville resonator guitarist R. Keenan Lawler, NYC bagpiper David Watson, and Tokyo guitarist Tetuzi Akiyama. /  / Kaori Suzuki is a Tokyo-born music maker/composer living in Oakland, CA. Her spiraling sound visions often take form in long durations, using electroacoustic sound technologies, high-register electronics, modified acoustic instruments, and tape. She seeks to create heightened listening states, emphasizing finding ‘music’ within activated space-time. She has toured and performed her music in numerous venues and settings across the US, Japan, Europe, Mexico, and Canada, and has released her music on independent labels in Germany and the US. Her current projects include her solo compositions involving modified instruments and electronics; drumming in the Oakland-based Minimalist psych-punk group Night Collectors; playing cello and guitar in the Ecstatic Music Band; her durational music for vhf-combination tones; and on-going collaborations with John Krausbauer in immersive light/sound happenings.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

The evening also features musician Lyra Pramuk, performing the North American debut of material from her album Fountain, set to be released on March 20th via Iceland’s Bedroom Community label. Entrance is free for ISSUE Members. /  / Known for presenting complex, unnoticed or unapproachable conditions and environments, Jacob Kirkegaard returns to ISSUE to perform a piece from his recent Opus Mors project, a powerfully detailed sonic meditation into four significant death processes rendered as listening spaces. The series portrays four sound environments that the human body commonly will be surrounded by or exposed to in the immediate post mortem: a morgue, an autopsy, a cremation and the decomposition -- events that no one can physically experience because of the very fact of death. At ISSUE, Kirkegaard presents one piece from the series, Opus Autopsia, featuring detailed and precise near-field sound recordings of a full autopsy starting with opening the corpse, following the removal and slicing and cutting open all the organs and brain, to finally returning all the organs, closing and washing the corpse. Released as a part of a 4 LP set of the full cycle of work, Opus Autopsia is presented alongside an expansive “track list” that provides insight into the timbre of the unique human organs. Limited copies of this rare edition will be available at the performance. /  / Lyra Pramuk presents the North American debut of material from her upcoming album Fountain, a song cycle created entirely from her own voice, although often shaped and structured by electronics. The title is derived from her family name, Pramuk, which translates from Czech as “well spring” or “fountain.” Often wordless, these songs evoke the ritual force of drowning, immersion, cleansing, and bathing -- also referred to in the album artwork by acclaimed visual artist Donna Huanca. Fountain approaches rhythms, speech, body, and the relation between technology and humanity, thematically exploring a post-human, non-binary understanding of life and the fragile ecosystems it depends on. As a vocal activist and member of the queer community, Fountain’s creation also coincided with a personal rejuvenation for its author. Its completion culminated in the live premiere of the album material at Unsound Festival in Krakow in 2019, where she performed through a multi-channel array designed by Ben Frost, opening for Sunn O))) and Roly Porter. /  / Before the long-awaited renovation of our 22 Boerum theater begins in April, ISSUE presents a special series of events that reflect on the organization’s trajectory as a home for experimental performance. Featuring artists from across our history as well as new projects, these events mark a milestone moment to celebrate in the theater and support ISSUE as we embark on a period of off-site programming. Join us in bringing commissions, premieres, and rare performances to new contexts and spaces throughout New York City. /  / The sound art of Jacob Kirkegaard explores ways to reflect on complex, unnoticed or unapproachable conditions and environments. His works have treated themes such as radioactivity in Chernobyl and Fukushima, melting ice in the Arctic, and border walls in Palestine. His two recent works are immersive acoustic explorations into global waste management and of processes generally unfolding when a human being dies. Since 2006 Kirkegaard been extensively researching, recording and creating works using otoacoustic emissions; tones generated from the actual human ear.

While the American operatically-trained vocalist and electronic musician is perhaps previously best known for her work with musical collaborators such as Holly Herndon and Colin Self, she is set to release her debut album, Fountain, via Iceland’s Bedroom Community label in March 2020. Collaborations with the visual artist Donna Huanca, freelance writing projects, and an ongoing international performance schedule, are part of a variety of creative nodes that feedback into Lyra’s practice. Lyra moved to Berlin in 2013 as a DAAD postgraduate study scholarship recipient, following her degree at the Eastman School of Music in New York. Since then, she has also been awarded residencies at Elektronmusikstudion EMS Stockholm, Open Port Club Residency in Tokyo and Sapporo, and Future Music Lab of the Atlantic Music Festival in Maine. Her interests also encompass writing, poetry, and fashion, where she is sometimes called upon as a model. As a performance artist, she has collaborated extensively with Donna Huanca and at events such as Glasgow International and the Rochester Fringe Festival.","('40.6906095', '-73.98937055')"

Known for his astonishing level of creativity and expansive critiques of many traditional conceptions about experimental music, Lewis has charted new ground in the fields of improvisation, interactive music, nonhierarchical collaboration, and computer music. Lewis has also worked as a trombonist in bands for years, served as a curator at The Kitchen, developed Voyager (an early and groundbreaking software capable of improvising with live performers), and authored a monumental history of the AACM (Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). /  / At ISSUE, Lewis presents a “portrait concert” of four recent works performed by musicians Laura Cocks, Seth Parker Woods, Dana Jessen, Conrad Harris & Pauline Kim. All four of these “recombinant” works use software to draw from acoustic sounds to create multiple digitally created sonic personalities that follow diverse yet intersecting spatial trajectories. The software for all four works was written by Dr. Damon Holzborn. /  / Emergent, written for flutist Claire Chase, is the first in this series. Here, the delays, trajectories, and timbre transformations combine to create a musical dance of agency. Although the work does not deploy explicit models of self-similarity, the more immediate spatial trajectories expand into larger trajectories of analogous affect across the progress of the piece. /  / Not Alone, the second work in the series, was written for cellist Seth Parker Woods. The electronics and the cello blend, intersect, and ultimately diverge into multiple digital personalities that can suddenly converge into unified ensembles while shrouding their origin in processes of repetition. The composition is dedicated to cellist Abdul Wadud, one of the leading members of the Black Artist Group. /  / Seismologic, the third piece in the series, was written for bassoonist Dana Jessen, with inspiration from the musically oriented seismologist Ben Holtzman of Columbia University. Here, foreground and background deliberately conflate, and delays are used create Doppelgängers that blur the boundaries between original and copy, or even transform the bassoon into an ultra-contrabassoon. /  / Memory/Mutation, written for the duo String Noise (Conrad Harris and Pauline Kim), is the latest in the series, and the first to feature more than one acoustic instrumentalist. Listeners might be surprised to hear that this piece was inspired by the duo’s extraordinary performance at Ostrava Days 2017 of an Alvin Lucier work for two violins. /  / PROGRAM: / Emergent (2014), for flute and electronics / Laura Cocks, flute /  / Not Alone (2014-15), for cello and electronics / Seth Parker Woods, cello /  / Intermission /  / Seismologic (2017), for bassoon and electronics / Dana Jessen, bassoon /  / Memory/Mutation (2019), for two violins and electronics / String Noise: Conrad Harris and Pauline Kim, violins /  / Before the long-awaited renovation of our 22 Boerum theater begins in April, ISSUE presents a special series of events that reflect on the organization’s trajectory as a home for experimental performance. Featuring artists from across our history as well as new projects, these events mark a milestone moment to celebrate in the theater and support ISSUE as we embark on a period of off-site programming. Join us in bringing commissions, premieres, and rare performances to new contexts and spaces throughout New York City. /  / George E.

The third incarnation of a work first created through a computer algorithm coded by Spiegel, the piece is spatialized by Cluett, Artist-in-Residence at Nokia Bell Labs. The evening also features Milan-based composer Caterina Barbieri presenting new work for the first time at ISSUE. /  / Laurie Spiegel’s A Harmonic Algorithm 2011 is the third incarnation of a series of algorithms that Spiegel first coded on her Apple II computer around 1980. In her program notes for the piece, Spiegel notes, “At Bell Labs, it had occurred to me [...] that if a composer creates individual ‘pieces of music’ that at the end of his/her life there will only be a finite number of musical works by that composer. If instead of composing individual finite length works, a composer could encode in computer software their personal compositional methods, preferences, processes and ways of making musical decisions, and somehow their aesthetic sensibility too, then they could go on composing and generating new music long after the biological human had ceased to exist.” /  / She continues, “In figuring out this particular logic, I spent a lot of time studying the harmonic progressions in Bach's Chorals, on which I based this software. I had happened upon a wonderful used book, ""The Contrapuntal Harmonic Technique of the 18th Century"" (Allen Irvine McHose, 1947) that was extremely helpful to me while figuring out the logic I coded into these algorithms. (A compositional algorithm is basically just a set of rules, a description in an artificial computer language of a process of decision-making, a sort of a written ‘score’ that embodies a procedure for composing, except that instead of humans playing from that score, a machine does.)” /  / Working in dialogue with Spiegel on the multi-channel loudspeaker array at Bell Labs, Seth Cluett will create a new diffusion of the work that will take advantage of the unique acoustics of 22 Boerum Place. /  / At ISSUE, Caterina Barbieri performs her own distinct style of pattern-based synthesizer music. Barbieri explores themes related to machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through a focus on minimalism. Following 2017’s acclaimed 2LP “Patterns of Consciousness”, Barbieri recently released “Ecstatic Computation,” a new full-length LP on Editions Mego. The album revolves around the creative use of complex sequencing techniques and pattern-based operations to explore the artefacts of human perception and memory processes by ultimately inducing a sense of ecstasy and contemplation. Computation is turned from being a formal, automatic writing technique into a creative, psychedelic practice to generate temporal hallucinations. Equally nervous and ecstatic, the fast permutation of patterns can create a state where time stands still whilst simultaneously being in motion -- where the perception of the present is constantly refreshed, in an endless sense of loss, re-discovery and the search for self-orientation. /  / Composer Laurie Spiegel's music draws on her classical training, pre-classical lute, and folk guitar and banjo roots; however, she is also a computer programmer, software designer, visual and video artist, and a published theorist. She is known for her pioneering work with several early electronic and computer music systems, focusing largely on interactive software that uses algorithmic logic to supplement and extend human abilities, and on the aesthetics of musical structure and cognitive process. Spiegel's visual works­—computer graphics, video, drawings, and photography—have been exhibited in the United States, Europe, and Japan. She has directed computer and electronic music studios and taught composition at Cooper Union and at New York University, where she founded its first computer music studio. Her realization of Johannes Kepler's Harmony of the Planets was sent into space as the opening cut of the Voyager Spacecraft's record Sounds of Earth (1977). Spiegel's recorded works have been available on 1750 Arch, Capriccio, Philo, Unseen Worlds, and other labels. Her computer software for music, such as Music Mouse—An Intelligent Instrument­ (1986), has been published for Amiga, Atari, and Macintosh computers. Spiegel has received fellowships and grants from the New York State Council on the Arts, ASCAP, and the Experimental Television Lab at WNET, among others. She is a freelance composer for film, dance, and other media, as well as a writer, software developer, visual artist, and a consultant in computer music, audio software design, and in other areas of information technology. Spiegel's studies include an A.B. from Shimer College and an M.A. from Brooklyn College, and additional studies at Oxford and Juilliard. /  / Seth Cluett is a composer and visual artist who creates work that explores everyday actions at extreme magnification, examines minutae by amplifying impossible tasks, and tries to understand the working of memory in forms that rethink the role of the senses in an increasingly technologized society. Ranging from photography and drawing to installation, concert music, and critical writing, his “subtle…seductive, immersive” (Artforum) sound work has been characterized as “rigorously focused and full of detail” (e/i) and “dramatic, powerful, and at one with nature” (The Wire). The recipient of grants from Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Fund and Meet the Composer, his work has been presented internationally at venues such as The Whitney Museum, MoMA/PS1, Moving Image Art Fair, CONTEXT Art Miami, GRM, and STEIM. His concert work has been commissioned by ensembles ranging from the Hong Kong Sinfonietta and the International Contemporary Ensemble to So Percussion, Catch Guitar Quartet, and Clogs and is documented on Line, Sedimental, Notice, and Winds Measure recordings. Cluett is the Assistant Director of the Computer Music Center and Sound Art Program at Columbia University and is Artist-in-Residence with Experiments in Art and Technology at Nokia Bell Labs where he maintains a studio and is active in research on virtual and augmented reality acoustics and multi-sensory communication. More information: http://www.sethcluett.com /  / Caterina Barbieri (b.1990, Bologna, Italy) is an Italian composer who explores themes related to machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through a focus on minimalism. She is interested in the polyphonic and polyrhythmic potential of synthesizers to draw complex geometries in space and time. Barbieri holds a diploma in classical guitar and a bachelor's degree in electroacoustic music from the conservatory of Bologna, Italy, alongside a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Humanities and Philosophy of Bologna with a thesis in Ethnomusicology about Hindustani music and minimalism.Since 2013 she has researched and produced music at Elektronmusikstudion in Stockholm, where she has intensively composed for the Buchla 200 system. She has performed at MaerzMusik and Berlin Atonal, Mutek, Unsound, Sonar, Primavera Sound, Barbican Centre, Philharmonie de Paris, CTM, Ableton Loop, Moogfest and La Biennale di Venezia. Her 2017 2LP Patterns of Consciousness was named in several “best of” music round-ups. In 2019 Barbieri released the LP Ecstatic Computation on Editions Mego.

No one I know in Ghana listens to this frenetic leftfield rap madness.” /  / The music on the recording—an amalgam of highlife, Twi language rap, funk, hip-hop, and electronica—traverses a pop music landscape that encapsulates international modes while reflecting contemporary Ghanaian music of the period. Presented with the sweaty passion of a Prince record and the lo-fi recording charm of early Chicago house music, Obaa Sima's joyous soul and casual brilliance made the enigmatic Ata Kak an underground internet sensation and party-starter the world over. After more than a decade of searching, Brian finally tracked down the singer and released the LP officially in March 2015. /  / “Its positive shine, relentless energy, and alien earworm choruses feel like a portal to an alternate reality, where the sounds of South Africa’s Shangaan electro, Mali’s Balani Show, Syria’s dabke, British grime, and Portuguese kuduro all sweat together.” – FACT Magazine /  / Tags","('40.679378', '-74.011894')"

Nitty Scott w/ saQi /  / Date: Friday, May 8th, 2020 / Tickets: $25 / Ages: 21+ / Doors: 6pm / Show: 8pm /  / Musician. Producer. Beatsmith. Recording artist. Composer. Dance-floor general. Label-head. A mystery man of many hats, The Polish Ambassador rocks more than just a trademark jumpsuit, authoring sublime, intentional artistic works, animated safaris in technicolor sound. At first breath, The Polish Ambassador was an experiment, David Sugalski’s sound-art passion project that came to life. An inventive, imaginary character born of humble, humorous beginnings, he found his first audiences through the support of primitive digital radio stations. Today, TPA is among the premier EDM/live crossover artists in the country with millions of listeners around the world; he’s consistently in-demand at the live music-focused gatherings and boutique electronic festivals from coast to coast. Founder of independent label Jumpsuit Records, an environmentalist and early progenitor of the permaculture action movement, the world’s funkiest diplomat is here to party with a purpose. /  / Since 2006, The Polish Ambassador has consistently released critically-acclaimed full-length albums on Jumpsuit Records, alongside a dizzying number of side-projects and multi-form collaborations. All the while launching the careers of a diverse smattering of artists that run the gamut in geography and genre. TPA continues to spread his wings in teaming up with eclectic musicians from around the world, including Matisyahu, Nitty Scott, Zion I, The Grouch, Mr. Lif, and dozens of others. He is one-half of the celebrated folktronica project Wildlight, a duo in which he pairs with ethereal songstress Ayla Nereo. /  / The Polish Ambassador’s prolific output incorporates many styles, from exuberant global-house to fatback mid-tempo funk, you’ll pick up on West African percussion alongside stirring Kirtan melodies, a psychedelic sax solo or a fresh verse from a Brooklyn female emcee. TPA employs live horns, keyboards, guitars, violins, and a bevy of talented instrumentalists on stage. “The Jumpsuited One” has headlined iconic venues like Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, and the renowned counter-culture gathering Oregon Country Fair. Suwannee Hulaween, Electric Forest, Envision Festival, and Lightning in a Bottle and other national festivals have each repeatedly invited TPA back across different years. /  / In alignment with TPA’s artistic ethos is a low-key lifestyle that places a premium on being present, living in harmony with nature, participating in community and inspiring it to thrive. Offstage, David Sugalski instigated a village-building convergence in his hometown in Northern California, and manages his own 25-acre homestead in the picture-Esque, rolling Sierra Nevada foothills. The farmer/carpenter lives modestly in a cabin he built on his land of the lush; TPA music is created in a solar-powered recording studio on the property. When he removes the famed bright blue-and-yellow 80’s jumpsuit and reverts back to his humanoid self, Sugalski is an avid solo bicyclist who enjoys venturing up California’s breathtaking coastal Highway 1; he’s a dedicated van-adventurer, having built out an exquisite tiny home inside a contractors van. /  / Sugalski plans his TPA tours for minimum carbon footprint, he advocates for healthy-beverage alternatives at music venues. Jumpsuit Records has donated tens of thousands of dollars to various non-profit organizations and charities; a portion of the label split goes to supporting non-profits voted on by fans. TPA’s awareness-in-action coalesces with numerous non-profit endeavors, including Jumpsuit Records, own 501(c) certified organization ActionDays.us. TPA decided to eliminate the merchandise from his business model, in order to facilitate a fan-operated buy-and-sell marketplace. The Polish Ambassador has evolved exponentially, from an art project to a vibration; a joyful community that thrives on the dance floor and finds freedom, connection, and collective oneness through this music. /  / Sale Dates and Times: /  / Public Onsale : Mon, 24 Feb 2020 at 01:00 PM","('40.7220528', '-73.9575486')"

1859,6/5/2020,Full Blast (Peter Brötzmann / Marino Pliakas / Michael Wertmüller) / John Wiese / Victoria Shen,First Unitarian Congreg,newyork,us,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1403860,20:00 - 22:00,"116 Pierrepont St., Brooklyn, NY 11201",$25 - 20,unknown,unknown,"Full Blast (Peter Brötzmann / Marino Pliakas / Michael Wertmüller), John Wiese, Victoria Shen","Friday, May 8th, ISSUE returns to the First Unitarian Congregational Society in Brooklyn Heights to present an expansive program of liberated sound featuring Peter Brötzmann’s trio outfit Full Blast with Marino Pliakas & Michael Wertmüller, as well as new solo work by artist and composer John Wiese, and musician, visual artist, and instrument maker Victoria Shen. /  / Their first North American tour in almost a decade, Full Blast is known, out of all the projects Brötzmann is currently working on, as being the most consistent and the longest running. With the precise and dynamic Swiss rhythm section of Marino Pliakas (electric bass) and Michael Wertmüller (drums), the group is referred to by Brotzmann himself as simply “THE TRIO.” Full Blast frequently conjures the essence of Brötzmann's landmark early free recording Machine Gun in its visceral intensity, while also, in the words of Tim Niland, being “far more than Peter Brötzmann with a rhythm section, [but] a fully functioning band that is a group of equals that play together as comrades.” /  / John Wiese presents the U.S. premiere of a new 8 channel composition commissioned by Ina/GRM. Known for his individual approach at the intersection of American noise and modern composition, Wiese’s artistic practice crosses many disciplines, but often shares conceptual similarities to musique concrète and is expressed through fixed recorded works, diffusions, performance, and installations. In 2016, Wiese was invited to perform at the Ina/GRM’s Présences Électronique Festival along with a residency at their multi-channel studio in the basement of Radio France. /  / ISSUE is also pleased to present Victoria Shen performing new solo work, following her collaborative performance of “Laminals II” last year with 2019 Artist-In-Residence Charmaine Lee. Shen’s music floods its location acting as a form of sculpture. Her music features analog modular synthesizers (Flower Electronics), contact microphones, and other self-built electronics. These instruments are designed to electronically create chaotic systems, systems which are highly sensitive to small changes in their initial parameters. The resulting music eschews conventions in harmony and rhythm in favor of the extreme textures and gestural tones. /  / An aggressive, emotive free jazz trio, Full Blast is another project of reedman Peter Brötzmann's touring and recording configurations and includes the explosive rhythm section of Marino Pliakas on electric bass and Michael Wertmüller on drums. Wertmüller and Brötzmann toured with each other for years as a duo, and Wertmüller and Pliakas worked with each other frequently on various festival gigs, as well. The trio issued a debut album, the self-titled Full Blast, in 2006 on the German Jazzwerkstatt imprint, following it with Black Hole on Atavistic in 2009. Recently, they have released a series of records on TROST, including Sketches and Ballads (2011) also featuring Ken Vandermark and Dirk Rothbrus, Risc (2016), and Rio (2018). The group has toured consistently since fall of 2004, visiting the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Chile, Japan, China, UK, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Slovenia, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Italy, France, Spain, Serbia, Ukraine, Switzerland, Egypt, Israel, and Russia. They have also performed and many international contemporary jazz and new music festivals, concert halls, clubs, and venues worldwide. /  / John Wiese is an artist and composer living and working in Los Angeles and Cleveland. From his experiments with recording as a teenager, he has since gone on to work in the world of contemporary sound art and the international experimental community. His sounds can be completely serene and sublime while at the same time being as equally frenetic and irregular, a sign of the artist’s ability to adapt and utilize a wide palette to build captivating aural works. As a performer and recording artist, his expertise in composition, texture, and experimentation with sound confirm his reputation of being an original and innovative voice in experimental music. /  / Victoria Shen is a musician, visual artist, and instrument maker native to San Francisco and working out of New England. Shen's sound practice is concerned with the spatiality/physicality of sound and its relationship to the human body. Shen's multidisciplinary visual work operates within the space where science, technology, craft, and art history overlap. Shen has performed solo across North America, Japan, Mexico, and Europe as Victoria Shen and Evicshen and as half of the duo TRIM in North America and the UK.

The pieces are a combination of canons and textural masses that utilize rational harmony to achieve dense yet calculated beatings in the critical band area. The record features Zach Rowden (contrabass) and Lucy Railton (cello) as the recorded musicians. Malone is known for using analog and digital synthesis within compositional frameworks that utilize unique tunings and psycho-acoustic phenomena. A recent string of albums explore this interplay within electroacoustic instrumentation: woodwinds with Buchla 200 synthesiser, strings quartets with sine waves, and – most notably – the pipe organ close mic’d and spatialized. These methods culminated in the major work The Sacrificial Code, which was Boomkat's album of the year for 2019. In the live context, Malone plays both organ-based and purely electronic shows. /  / Puce Mary returns to ISSUE for the first time since her appearance during 2014’s Swedish Energies festival. In 2018, Hoffmeier released a standout LP The Drought on PAN. Building from a reputation of arresting live performances and critically acclaimed releases, Hoffmeier broke new ground with The Drought, evolving the tropes of industrial and power electronics to forge an expanded vocabulary where space, harmony, and lyricism surface into a complex sonic and literary narrative. Her working methods have often been diverse, with a sound incorporating everything from concrete sound-poetry, first person narrative, and deliberate collages of field recordings and sound sources into ominous drone and dense feedback. /  / Tongue Depressor, the experimental instrumental duo of Zach Rowden and Henry Birdsey, work with various instrumental arrangements, but most often with fiddles. Inviting a vague narrative around Appalachian Pentecostalism, the duo has released five volumes of ecstatic, trance-inducing fiddle music, with pieces dedicated to figures such as the late snake-handling pastor Jamie Coots, French pharmacist Joseph Bienaimé Caventou, and other obscure Appalachian names such as Darlene Summerford, Maudie Lankford, and more. At ISSUE, the duo performs their singular fiddle duo alongside orchestra bells and aluminum nesting dolls. /  / Headquartered in Stockholm, Kali Malone is an American composer and musician who creates sonic monoliths that tug at the very material of listening. Employing acoustic and synthetic instrumentation in repetitive and extended durations, Malone’s rich harmonic textures emit a distinct emotive hue serving to generate a captivating and uncanny depth of focus. Malone has performed extensively throughout Europe and North America, with notable features at Berlin Atonal, Moogfest, Cafe Oto, Le Guess Who?, and Ina GRM. She has collaborated and performed with a variety of artists including Caterina Barbieri, Ellen Arkbro, Sorrowing Christ, Puce Mary, Free The Land, Zach Rowden, Leila Bordreuil and Lucy Railton. In 2016 she co-founded the record label XKatedral together with Maria W Horn. She holds both a BFA and MFA in electro-acoustic composition from the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. /  / Puce Mary is the solo moniker of Danish born experimental artist, Frederikke Hoffmeier. Since her first LP released in 2013, the project has explored the fields of industrial noise and experimental music with a vast number of releases on labels such as PAN, Posh Isolation, iDEAL Recordings, and Ascetic House. Often identified with the now-generation of power electronics, Puce Mary has a reputation for intense live-performances that span from gripping renditions of fresh material to the the full-on fury of off-the-cuff harsh noise. Her working methods are diverse, with a sound that is constantly evolving through her latest live sets and releases, to recent collaborative work with Francesco Leali, Heith, and Alessandro Branca. /  / Tongue Depressor (New Haven, CT) is the duo of Henry Birdsey (fiddle, lap steel) and Zach Rowden (fiddle, upright bass, microtonal organ). They write, improvise, and perform music that draws from the fields of drone, harsh noise, and church music, often using microtonal tunings. Recent projects and releases include the the ongoing Fiddle Music series (currently 5 volumes), Dregs (December 2019/ Thalamos), Broad Is The Road That Leads To Death (2018 C/Site Recordings), and To See Not, a trio recording with percussionist Trevor Saint (Glockenspiel) released via Obsolete Staircases (Kentucky). /  / Henry Birdsey is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and recording engineer from Vermont, working primarily with pedal steel + lap steel, microtonal organ, violin, and homemade instruments. His music is often drone-based and involves microtonal tunings, the amplification of metal, and fragments of church music. /  / Zach Rowden is a American multi-instrumentalist that deals with the in-between of music and perception. The music he makes occupies genres such as spectral music, drone, folk & religious musics as well as harsh noise. He is currently based in New Haven, Connecticut.

Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.","('40.7601258', '-73.9800192')"

While maintaining residencies in various New York clubs over the years, Juan has graced the decks at legendary venues like Berlin’s Panorama Bar, Tokyo’s Womb, Sao Paulo’s D-Edge, Lisbon’s Luxe, Fabric of London, and countless others in between. He quickly established a reputation as an eclectic and adaptive DJ, utilizing years of music making and performance experience to develop a finely tuned sensitivity to quality selection and reading a room. Never much of a genre purist, Juan’s sets can feature the gamut from Disco to House to some Techno, with detours into Electro or proto-House along the way, often in the same night.

After a weekly internet radio show led to some bookings, Mrs Magoo found herself increasingly drawn to the sounds of jungle and dnb and by 2013 she was a certified junglist. That year saw her playing her first headline set at Jungle Nation in Aberdeen, one of Scotland’s longest running jungle nights. /  / Joining Deep in the Jungle Records and residencies at Jungle Splash London, Unity Edinburgh and Better Breakbeat Bureau USA have helped her carve out a name for herself. She’s now taken things full circle; from early days listening to mixtapes - to making her own, from a bright eyed young raver taking her first tentative steps into Rebirth, to performing at Glastonbury Festival the largest greenfield festival in the world.  /  / Magoo’s just beginning though, she’s got big plans: her own line of merchandise, producing her own music and many more international bookings. She’s one to keep an eye on. /  / Facebook - www.facebook.com/mrsmagoodnb / Soundcloud - www.soundcloud.com/mrsmagoo / Twitter - www.twitter.com/MrsMagoo_DnB  / Instagram - www.instagram.com/mrsmagoo_dnb /  / For bookings please contact [email protected] /  / This will be an event not to be missed!!!

This event continues a monthly residency at MotorCity Wine with the Rocksteady Disco friendship circle. /  / JKriv is a Brooklyn-based producer, DJ, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and label-owner. With a professional musical career stretching nearly 2 decades, J has gained serious attention recently for his masterfully crafted disco reworks, original productions, and rousing DJ sets. A Traxsource Top-20 Nu Disco / Indie Dance artist for the past 2 years, his tracks have been played by DJs such as Derrick Carter, Disclosure, Andrew Weatherall, Louie Vega, Kenny Dope, Mark Farina, Greg Wilson, and have gained mainstream support from Drake and Majid Jordan in their Apple Music OVO Radio show, as well as legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong and BB6’s Craig Charles. /  / Bringing a seasoned musicality to everything he touches, JKriv’s talent for organic production and songwriting is evident in his original songs Another Night, Make It Hot and Redo, as well as his recent disco opus Vertigo, released October 2018 on Joey Negro’s Z Records. A sprawling production with dazzling live instrumentation performed primarily by J himself, Vertigo shows J’s knack for seamlessly melding modern and retro club sounds. /  / With releases on Disco Deviance, Barefoot Beats, Secret Squirrels, Whiskey Disco and his own Razor-N-Tape among others, J has solidified his status as a master of the modern edit/rework, and has been called on to remix numerous artists such as Dimitri from Paris, Imagination, Escort and more. Luke Solomon recently tapped J to remix his anthemic Powerdance tune A Safe and Happy Place. J’s remix, another disco belter which set late-summer Ibiza dance floors alight, is set to drop October 2018 on Classic Music. A purveyor and curator of outer-national sounds as well, JKriv dropped Ferias ’77, an album of varied Brazilian reworks on Razor-N-Tape or RSD 2018, and also has remixed for Soundway Records and Africa Seven. /  / Like his productions, JKriv’s DJ sets showcase his deep and diverse taste, weaving eclectic disco, house, and offbeat selections together seamlessly, always with an ear for groove and harmony, and an eye to the dance floor. In addition to regular nights at hometown hotspots Black Flamingo, Le Bain, Good Room, Output and Elsewhere, J has performed and DJ’d in over 30 countries and nearly every state in the continental US, sharing bills with Todd Terje, Session Victim, Joey Negro, and many more. JKriv is also a foundational member of the live disco band Escort, co-writing, producing, and touring with the group at Coachella, Sasquatch Festival and innumerable club gigs around the world. JKriv has been announced on the lineup for the boutique Mareh Music festival in Brazil for NYE 2019. /  / JKriv’s talents as a tastemaker extend beyond the studio and DJ booth, as co-owner of respected Brooklyn record label Razor-N-Tape. RNT now boasts a 50 release-deep catalog that has garnered support and spins from some of the biggest names in modern dance music, and is one of the most respected and consistent new disco labels in the game today. /  / He'll be joined by Peter Croce. The 2 will be playing 5 hours of unexpected and danceable deep house, jazz, funk, balearic, disco, techno, and other spirit music. /  / More information below... /  / +++ JKriv: https://soundcloud.com/jkriv /  / +++ Peter Croce: https://soundcloud.com/petercroce /  / No cover / 21+ / artwork by Gino / food by NOODL","('42.3311588', '-83.0730347247209')"

It’s for that reason his DJ style espouses diversity. Dean takes listeners on unexpected journeys through a diverse array of soundscapes anytime he’s manning the helm.  /  / Previously on the Australian underground music scene, Dean started and ran HAHA Industries and played regularly alongside Dave Fernandes (House of Mince/Aus) for over a decade. As D&D, they warmed the floors alongside some of the world’s most prominent international electronic music makers and forged a musical pathway down the side streets, forgotten laneways and dark warehouse spaces that made up the more unique aspects of the Sydney late night party scene. /  / Dean relocated to Bali in 2017 to take on a DJ residency at Indonesia’s highly lauded Potato Head Beach Club. He quickly also took on residencies at several other key establishments on the island, including Rock Bar, The W Hotel, Karma Beach Bali, and many others. Dean’s skills have landed him at gigs further afield in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Australia and his native Canada. He’s supported everyone from heavyweights like Robert Hood, Juan Atkins and Kenny Larkin to eclectic diggers like Optimo and Tim Sweeney to the bastion of Balearic sound, Jon Sa Trinxa. Dean has more recently decided to start 2020 off in his original homeland, Canada and presently hosts his monthly radio show, “Inner Circles” from the CTRL room studios in Toronto between his guest spots. /  / His endless pursuit to find weird and wonderful sounds and share them with others creates special moments each and every time he plays, whether that’s at a 4000-person venue warming up the dance floor for a Platinum award-winning or Grammy nominated international act on New Year’s Eve or serving up more intimate Balearic sounds at a beach club during sunset. /  / He'll be joined by Peter Croce.

Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.","('42.341363', '-83.060217')"

His 2nd release, 'Indastria 2028' followed in May on his own label Main Course (with partners Astronomar & Neoteric). Next up are 2 smashers for Blood Music (Trails/One Hour) which will see the light in July and have since debuted in Fake Blood's Fabric Live 69 compilation. To round out the year, Bot joins the crew at Southern Fried once again, to drop the ""Friday Pulse"" EP and remixes, featuring the legendary Robert Owens. On top of that, more music from Bot and friends is being prepared for Main Course, and he's stayed busy remixing the likes of Diplo & Wiley. One thing is for certain; there are no plans to slow down! /  / + / EDDIE PORTILLO (MADHOUSE DJ'S) / MARY DROPPINZ (MDA : NATIVE INSTRUMENTS : XENOPHILE) / TRAVIS DAGZ (WCP) /  / 3pm-10pm / 21+ Welcome w/ ID / Giveaways & Drink Specials / Tickets: Early Bird: $10, $15, $17.50, $20, $25 at door /  / Location: / The Rose / 245 E.

We are very happy to announce that we are continuing with our curve ball bookings by bringing you one of LA's best kept secrets, the truly masterful producer and deep digging selector Urulu (Liquid Earth) and the hardest working force and creator in Boston Underground Manu Miran (Visceral). Join us for a ride. /  / Urulu  /  / The singular brand of house music that Taylor Freels produces as Urulu is uniquely transatlantic, infusing the rhythmic sensibilities of London and Berlin with the sun-soaked serenity of his native California. Described by RA as having an “impressively complete grasp of what makes a classic house cut”, this talented producer has dropped acclaimed releases on respected imprints such as NYC's Let's Play House and Melbourne’s Voyage Recordings, as well as taste-making outlets such as Needwant, Shabby Doll and Spanish outfit Saft/Pulp. In addition to his considerable abilities as a creator of high-voltage dance music, Freels is also an inspired selector, armed with the chutzpah to mix ruff-n-ready Detroit and Chicago emanations with modern, future-facing house sounds. /  / With evocative, retro-futuristic productions that showcase a stripped back, classic feel, Urulu's sounds are a throwback to the lost generation of classic groove-makers. The Los Angeles-based producer has a well-honed knack for finding a track's sweet spot. His dynamic arrangements instantly piqued the interest of peers, critics and fans alike following his releases on Let’s Play House, Saft and Voyage Recordings, in addition to well-received releases on his own imprint Amadeus Records, Urulu has made a name for himself as a visionary producer specialising in euphoric nostalgia, working with an extensive sonic toolkit that includes emotive vocal samples, weighty percussion, luscious chords and low-slung basslines. / 2018 has seen two of Urulu’s finest releases yet: the ‘Banshee EP’ on venerable Spanish imprint Saft, and the distinctly psychedelic ‘Foreign Depths’ for hotly-tipped Dutch label Kalahari Oyster Cult. With a tightly-packed DJ schedule and more unabashedly ecstatic house wizardry in the works, Urulu’s meteoric career is set to continue rising. https://soundcloud.com/urulu /  / Manu Miran /  / Venezuelan-born curator, founder and resident DJ of Boston-based multidisciplinary platform, Visceral. Manu's vocation with establishing Visceral in 2016, stemmed from the shortage of marginalized POC & LGBTQ+ talent within his community. Manu and Visceral's mission to promote diversity & cultural inclusivity, in addition to merging music with visual arts, has been essential to the growth of the POC and Queer scene in Boston. Miran's music genre draws from a broad range of undercurrent sensuality rooted from the boldest, rawest sounds of Berlin, Detroit, and Latin America. https://soundcloud.com/manumiran /  / Residents: / Mike ETC  / ThoughtKnot (David OH) /  / And as Always /  / NO RACISM / NO MISOGYNY / NO TRANSPHOBIA / NO HOMOPHOBIA / NO ASSHOLES / NO GODS / NO MASTERS /  / RAVE QUEER",

Eleven albums, innumerable releases and decades of Djing into his career, the New York-turned-Berlin resident continues to push further into his own sound, craft, and mind. For those fortunate enough to be present for one of Fred's cathartic, physical and spiritual DJ sets, the dancefloor is not just a place for enjoyment, but for potential. /  / That opportunity for potential – his own, yours, that of our collective consciousness – has long-been the earnest pursuit of Fred P, channeled expertly through his evolved and deeply personal exploration of house and techno music. His futurist approach is inspired as much by the scene's bonafide revolutionaries, Frankie Knuckles to David Morales and Danny Tenaglia, as his own futurist philosophy, weaved together from a glorious patchwork inspired by an ever-expanding network or thinkers, collaborators, and international encounters. /  / If this all sounds rather academic, then any appearance from Fred P will cement the sound of his vision. Years dancing at New York nightspots such as Red Zone, Sound Factory and Tunnel proved to be the sort of open-minded education that cannot be bought, cannot be sold and cannot be hyped. Here, among an eclectic cast throng of consciously aligned fellow party-goers, Fred P learned pleasure and patience from extensive record collections that often went some way to suggest that less can mean more. /  / It's a confidence that runs through his music and Djing, and most recently earned him a quarterly residency split between London's twin clubs, Oval Space and Pickle Factory, sharing the bill with like-minded contemporaries. He was also handed control of the club's sound system for several all-night sessions, a favorite format of his, creating space to conjure a unique, sensual and almost psychedelic early morning atmosphere that the New York native is almost notorious for being able to conjure like few others (refer to his own cult classic, '6AM' for a seductive glimpse of this particular sound.) /  / All this in mind, what's the eventual aim? /  / “Like-minds together, to raise each other's consciousness”, he considers. “And with that, you can have an experience. I'm all for that because I know music can be medicine. Meditation... It's a gift for everybody. So to use it with intent but not self-interest – which is very difficult nowadays – it's all about the time you're given and the quality of what you decide to do with that time.” /  / Time passes, for better or worse, and with that, change must be embraced. 2018 sees Fred P bring his acclaimed Soul People Music outlet to an end and embrace a new label, Perpetual Sound. Launching with a new recording for arguably his best-loved alias, Black Jazz Consortium, the label will be guided solely by his proven eye for emotion and evolution, anticipating new collaborations and styles. /  / That first release was a statement, tellingly titled ‘Evolutions’, adorned with a retro-futurist cover that harks back, perhaps with a sigh, to retro-sixties futurism. On the cusp of an AI revolution, in the midst of political, cultural and social tension and disruption on an international scale, Fred P is determined to ensure optimism and futurism lead forward his practice. /  / “The 20th century was big on originality... The 21st century, so far, not too much”, he reflects. “That attitude in general, towards everything, pushes this singular ethos. The us or nothing bullshit. So what's standing in the way of the obvious stuff? What is the end goal? The end goal is to fully embrace our potential and to remove the things that hold us back: Greed, envy, and self-interest. To embrace a more humanitarian approach Not just for ourselves, but for our species.”",

The inclusion of the word ‘Corps’ is meant as a synonym for ‘unity or a body of people engaged in a particular activity.’ The inspiration behind Rocky Hill is Sassounian’s drive to bring both the sounds he was introduced to as a child, and the ones self-discovered from his bedroom, onto the dance floor: “Rocky Hill is my home; it’s where I grew up. It’s where I was introduced to my likes and dislikes, and where I feel the safest. That’s what I wish my colleagues and artists to feel.” Sassounian prefers to maintain a close knit and indie mindset when working with artists under his wing. /  / Arthur Kaplan and Gabe Lopez grew up in Miami together. They both studied Art and Design from an early age. Kaplan’s focus is Fabrication and Production Design, while Lopez’s focus is in Industrial Design. Both moved out to Los Angeles to pursue their careers a few years ago. Kaplan is the art director for Rocky Hill, while Lopez is a collaborative consultant. Darone Sassounian is born and raised in Los Angeles. He previously worked at Backside Records as a record buyer and Ubiquity Records as a label coordinator. He currently is the agent for artists such as, Bosq and Basil & Rogers. /  / The trio first met at a music venue in Los Angeles in 2016. Having similar tastes in music, the three began experimenting with sounds and started to play records they admired, all in the presence of good company. “The three of us are drawn towards many different sounds. When we play records together, there’s a natural cohesion of unique sounds that blend well with one another. It varies from afro boogie, disco, house, and techno. It’s all music with a soul; some rare and some not so rare.” /  / www.rockyhillrecords.us","('34.1176619166667', '-118.260877791667')"

The project has since evolved into a blissfully painful wall of sound interweaving shoegaze, ambient, electro-industrial, sludge, and something akin to Sleep meets Stereolab. Draag gained a reputation for their sonically immersive live shows, transforming the most DIY to the most sophisticated of spaces into what was described as a dive into a Neptunian air chamber – a storm in slow motion. “Nontoxic Process,” a compilation of tracks released in 2018 with the first single “Sorry (Dispensa)” premiered by Noisey, was created in the midst of severe health complications, forcing the band to write in a visceral and honest form without pretension.

The project has since evolved into a blissfully painful wall of sound interweaving shoegaze, ambient, electro-industrial, sludge, and something akin to Sleep meets Stereolab. Draag gained a reputation for their sonically immersive live shows, transforming the most DIY to the most sophisticated of spaces into what was described as a dive into a Neptunian air chamber – a storm in slow motion. “Nontoxic Process,” a compilation of tracks released in 2018 with the first single “Sorry (Dispensa)” premiered by Noisey, was created in the midst of severe health complications, forcing the band to write in a visceral and honest form without pretension.","('34.0768642727273', '-118.260951454545')"

Born in Hamburg in 1990, August composes and performs multifaceted electronic music with hopeful tones and a human aesthetic. “Creating music - the act of creating in general - should be free from rationalization. In the best case, relying solely on subconsciousness communication,” says the classically trained multi-instrumentalist. Speaking with David, one immediately realizes the value that he places upon his well-earned artistic independence and steadfast sincerity. This hard-fought pursuit can be traced clearly through the producer’s recorded works; from a string of early dance singles and remixes (2010-2014), followed by his celebrated debut album, Times (2013), to a handful of genre-defying outings on Ninja Tune sub-label, Counter Records (2016), the Tonmeister graduate (2017) continues to uncloak hidden inner paths yet to be discovered. /  / It is precisely this sense of conviction that has lured August to Palestrina, a crumbling, lesser-known, rural town, resting high in the peaks of Monti Prenestini, a colossal mountain range, towering across central Italy. The birthplace of his mother, this highland outpost has, as of recent, casted rays of inspiration upon the young musician. “After 26 years, I suddenly feel the urgency to connect actively with my Mediterranean provenience and culture. Although always present in me, I rather kept it hidden, private and absent from my creative work. These roots have always evoked the stronger emotions within me.” /  / While his live-show takes various shapes and forms, free improvisation lives at the core of the artist’s fascination. Whether he performs solo for the Boiler Room (2014) or a Resident Advisor Live Session (2015), recruits trusted musicians as part of his Ensemble (2015-2016), DJ’s traditionally or explores collaboration with the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin (2016), liberating moments of immediate expression remain a constant. /  / After a year of self-examination and introspection, August has re-emerged with a vitalizing, advanced, personal language. His latest albums D’Angelo and DCXXXIX A.C are impassioned documents written in this language, suited to express the emotions he’d kept hidden until now. His new label, 99CHANTS, promotes his own works and that of unsung new talents (Louis Sterling) and appreciated figures (Ambienti Coassialli, Giulio Aldinucci, Rafael Anton Irisarri, Ron Trent) who share this language, free of the constraints of a set genre or mood. For August, “finding the courage to have a true dialogue with myself has been a challenging process, a never-ending path [that] I hope to explore in the most honest way possible”.","('34.10127845', '-118.323253377829')"

Frankie was raised in home filled with music, his grandfather was a musician in Puerto Rico and his father regularly plays and sings in bands in New York. As an adolescent, Frankie was exposed to and enthralled by the vibrant hip-hop culture that was exploding all over New York City, and he soon convinced his parents to buy him some DJ gear. Here then, was the genesis of Frankie’s DJ career…a fourteen year old, cutting, scratching and mimicking what he heard at block parties and on underground hip-hop radio shows. /  / A couple of years later, Frankie was introduced to house music through his older cousins who were regulars at the famed Paradise Garage. His first clubgoing experience was at Hearthrobs’s, with the resident being a then relatively unknown ‘Little Louie’ Vega. As Frankie continued to develop as a DJ and a producer, he also was inspired by house giants such as Shep Pettibone, Tony Humphries and Timmy Regisford. /  / After a brief stint working in promotions at Strictly Rhythm Records in 1990, he moved into DJ’ing and producing full time, with his first serious paid gig at none other than the famous Ministry Of Sound in London.

Emerging in the fall of 2013 in a garage full of broken, sentimental equipment, Draag began as a solo project of Adrian Acosta, trained as a mariachi singer by his father who was an established norteño musician. He went on to recruit members influenced by disparate upbringings in the worlds of underground punk, no wave, experimental jazz, and classical music training. The project has since evolved into a blissfully painful wall of sound interweaving shoegaze, ambient, electro-industrial, sludge, and something akin to Sleep meets Stereolab. Draag gained a reputation for their sonically immersive live shows, transforming the most DIY to the most sophisticated of spaces into what was described as a dive into a Neptunian air chamber – a storm in slow motion. “Nontoxic Process,” a compilation of tracks released in 2018 with the first single “Sorry (Dispensa)” premiered by Noisey, was created in the midst of severe health complications, forcing the band to write in a visceral and honest form without pretension.","('34.0768642727273', '-118.260951454545')"

Slowly these early experiments were forged into more club oriented constructions which Henri soon began road testing in his DJ sets each week.

This proved to be an important step in Henri's evolution as an electronic music producer, as he is now highly regarded as a sound engineer by all his industry contemporaries. His mastering prowess is sought after by some of the most widely respected producers and labels. Christian Smith, Guy J, Hernan Cattaneo, Pig & Dan, Hope Recordings, Lost & Found, microCastle, Octopus Recordings, Sudbeat, Transmit Recordings and Tronic are just a small selection of the many artists and labels that swear by Henri's mastering expertise. /  / Cid Inc has always featured a wide array of electronic music talents in his DJ sets. The Swedish producer is on a never ending search for the freshest sounds and most promising up and coming talent. This passion ultimately led to the creation of the Replug Records imprint in 2009.

Since its inception Replug has showcased cutting edge sounds from both up and coming and renowned artists such as Hernan Cattaneo & Soundexile, Khen, Nick Muir, Dmitry Molosh, Andre Sabota, Darin Epsilon, Simos Tagias, Chicola, Barry Jamieson, Navar, Jamie Ste-vens, Marcelo Vasami, Deepfunk, Kassey Voorn, Luis Junior and several other highly respected producers and artists.” /  / *21+ / Private Event / Location TBA /  / * Event details will be emailed before the beginning of the event. / * You are required to opt-in to our e-mail list in order to get updates regarding event details.

The project has since evolved into a blissfully painful wall of sound interweaving shoegaze, ambient, electro-industrial, sludge, and something akin to Sleep meets Stereolab. Draag gained a reputation for their sonically immersive live shows, transforming the most DIY to the most sophisticated of spaces into what was described as a dive into a Neptunian air chamber – a storm in slow motion. “Nontoxic Process,” a compilation of tracks released in 2018 with the first single “Sorry (Dispensa)” premiered by Noisey, was created in the midst of severe health complications, forcing the band to write in a visceral and honest form without pretension.","('34.0980789', '-118.3123144')"

These kingpins would occasionally drop filthy jacking ghetto records into their sets and the young impressionable producer fell in love with this sound. This booty based vibe went on to lay the foundation for Kill Frenzy’s initial releases on Ghetto Test (a subsidiary of the infamous Dust Traxx Records) and Juke Trax (DJ Godfather’s Ghetto Tech label). His rapid-fire juke joints, clocking around 160 BPM, were pure youthful adrenaline. /  / Not wanting to limit himself to just one style he started working on various other genres. Another EP was picked up immediately by Hervé of The Count of Monte Cristal with his Cheaper Thrills (UK) label. He continued to release tracks and remixes on various labels, flirting with different genres, while at the same time keeping that original ghetto house and booty flavour. /  / In 2012, Kill Frenzy signed to Claude VonStroke’s San Francisco based label dirtybird with his most well known release thus far, “Make That Booty Clap.” This massive record infected DJs as diverse as Soul Clap, Jamie Jones and Skrillex—the latter of whom helped turn this signature tune into a festival anthem. He went on to release several more records on dirtybird and became an important element in the very tight knit crew. /  / Taylr Swft, Kill Frenzy’s debut album on dirtybird, was described by label label boss VonStroke /  / as “ his secret weapon” that year. At one point he was playing seven tracks from the album in the same set - it was almost embarrassing! /  / Kill Frenzy has more recently released further tracks on dirtybird including 'Silo', 'Last Night'. Other releases include 'Break Loose' on Jackathon, 'Crystal Seed' on Turbo, and the ' 313 / I Feel EP' on Relief. His forthcoming single on W&O Street tracks '202' features Chambray is the one to watch out for in the coming months. /  / Last autumn Kill Frenzy is set to embark on a huge USA tour. Now armed with his own merchandise & T-Shirt range, Kill Frenzy’s diverse love for bizarre yet melodic, catchy underground house & techno is what has lured Djs and dancers worldwide, making him a force to be reckoned with. /  / ABOUT MDA EVENTS: /  / Known as one of Southern California’s premier independent promotion companies for over a decade, Modern Disco Ambassadors brings a unique blend of progressive and eclectic music to guests, featuring world-class international and national talent. /  / Join us for our weekly MDA Wednesdays event series at La Cave in Costa Mesa, Calif. 11 years and counting, MDA Wednesdays continues to bring national and international talent to a unique and intimate venue in the heart of Orange County.

It’s where I was introduced to my likes and dislikes, and where I feel the safest. That’s what I wish my colleagues and artists to feel.” Sassounian prefers to maintain a close knit and indie mindset when working with artists under his wing. /  / Arthur Kaplan and Gabe Lopez grew up in Miami together. They both studied Art and Design from an early age. Kaplan’s focus is Fabrication and Production Design, while Lopez’s focus is in Industrial Design. Both moved out to Los Angeles to pursue their careers a few years ago. Kaplan is the art director for Rocky Hill, while Lopez is a collaborative consultant. Darone Sassounian is born and raised in Los Angeles. He previously worked at Backside Records as a record buyer and Ubiquity Records as a label coordinator. He currently is the agent for artists such as, Bosq and Basil & Rogers. /  / The trio first met at a music venue in Los Angeles in 2016. Having similar tastes in music, the three began experimenting with sounds and started to play records they admired, all in the presence of good company. “The three of us are drawn towards many different sounds. When we play records together, there’s a natural cohesion of unique sounds that blend well with one another. It varies from afro boogie, disco, house, and techno.

Aaron’s eclectic and adventurous taste in tunes has kept audiences on their toes ever since he began DJ’ing in his hometown of Santa Fe, and his commitment to solid grooves and sounds has always kept the dance floor moving. He’s been on the move as well, traveling to new destinations in the US and Mexico while managing Wulfpack in Los Angeles and residencies at Burning Man’s legendary day parties at the DISTRIKT sound camp. Along with co-founder Jamie Schwabl, Aaron organizes the beast known as Wulfpack, one of Southern California’s most inclusive party crew. Under the Wulfpack banner, Aaron curates the Wulfcast guest mix series, their record label, and the event calendar. Wulfpack boasts an impressive and diverse roster, showcasing the incredible depth of talent in Southern California. In 2018, Wulfpack partnered with ChinoSound to throw the first Synergy Festival, a weekend of non-stop music in the Mojave desert, with the promise of more to come. Aaron has also been returning to his Drum n’ Bass roots with performances as his alter ego Aaron Jakobs, showcasing his range at bass music stages in addition to the groovy house and techno that has made him a staple of the underground.

After a long wait he has now started to play his first ever live performances in Europe. /  / Ata Kak’s Obaa Sima cassette fell on deaf ears when it was first self-released in Ghana in 1994 but when American musicologist Brian Shimkovitz stumbled upon the tape at a street stall in Cape Coast, Ghana eight years later it became the stimulus for him to launch his Awesome Tapes from Africa blog, writing in his inaugural post: ' This is it. The song is called Moma Yendodo. You may never hear anything like this elsewhere. No one I know in Ghana listens to this frenetic leftfield rap madness.' The music on the recording - an amalgam of highlife, Twi-language rap, funk, hip-hop and electronica – traverses a pop music landscape that encapsulates international modes while reflecting contemporary Ghanaian music of the period. Presented with the sweaty passion of a Prince record and the lo-fi recording charm of early Chicago house music, Obaa Sima 's joyous soul and casual brilliance made the enigmatic Ata Kak an underground internet sensation and a party-starter the world over. After more than a decade of searching Brian finally tracked down the singer and released the LP officially in March 2015.","('34.10918', '-118.19452')"

More notably is ‘Imprint of Pleasure’, a heart-wrenchingly poignant dance floor anthem released on Suara Records that was named Beatport’s 9thTop Selling Track of All Time, racked up a hefty 32 million streams on Spotify and has provided the soundtrack for festivals and dance floors for over many years. /  / Last year, Tube & Berger and Junior Jack's collaboration track ""E Samba 2018"" peaked at No.2 on the Beatport main chart and was No.1 in their House Chart for 6 weeks in Summer, gaining huge DJ support from the likes of Pete Tong, Erick Morillo, Fisher, Claptone, Flashmob and Nora En Pure. /  / Along with friend and fellow DJ Juliet Sikora they run the labels Kittball Records and ZEHN Records. Next to releasing their own tracks, both labels have signed prominent artists like &ME, Andhim, Betoko, Dennis Cruz, Djuma Soundsystem, Ida Engberg, illyus & Barrientos, Purple Disco Machine, Township Rebellion and many more. On Kittball, Tube & Berger released their debut studio album ‘Introlution’ back in 2012.

They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao).

Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.","('28.5377867142857', '-81.3773009591837')"

How they get you there is a heels over head traverse along the arc of a melting metronome, sometimes a few seconds long, sometimes an eternity. You land with each oscillation like a scrap of hay atop a stack of needles, a split second to yourself before their next tune plucks you by the ear, a comet tail of distortion streaming in your wake. If you haven't yet heard (and marvelled at the cover art) of their 2xLP on Fuck Yoga Records out of Macedonia, untwist yourself and figure it out fast. Consider it a metaphyical stretch before you're standing a few feet away from them inside the Peacock Lounge's Gold Room this Thursday. / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGrzEnuPsU /  / Pandiscordian Necrogenesis / The compelling contraint of lo-fi metal becomes far more stark when further constrained to the blinding blur of just two arms, two legs, and one forked tongue. How it's possible for one soul to let loose this tightening vortex of darkness that warps, leans, stretches and still destroys with pinpoint resolve is a diabolical mystery. Pandiscordian Necrogenesis is the solo project of San Francisco's Ephemeral Domignostika and if's clearly too intense for the likes of a Henry Rollins' collection, the Tasmanian Devil listens to absolutely nothing else.

Bill’s wife owns a local publication and is a skilled bicyclist (even though she has not gone professional.) /  / When David works in his studio where he makes electronic music, his wife brings him a drink and discusses her day. The door-keeper comes in to give him a telegram sent the previous year from the Eolian Islands. /  / In 2010 he wrote an album of music which was released by Freerange records. A year later David’s first and only daughter, Eloise Sylvia was born. She was 5 pounds 11 ounces at birth. David spoke only English and cooked meals for his family every day until 2013 when a company called Systematic Recordings contracted him for another album. /  / Besides writing music for night clubs and headphones, Pezzner composes music for vision and function, and teaches electronic music writing concepts to anyone who will pay him money.

On that fateful day, the two audiophiles got ridiculously tipsy and found their groove through a shared love of funky, fun, frivolous vibes...and Fernet. After closing out their electric set, the tipsy twosome came up with a hilarious moniker.

The Swedish artist has a distinct approach to life, as well as music, which is centred around tranquillity, stillness and the convergence of Zen meditation, nature and creativity. Known for his work as one half of Minilogue, Sebastian is also an accomplished solo artist with new material ready to roll. As an artist that is constantly evolving he has taken a bold new direction in his sonic exploration, immersing himself in the neo-classical scene and joining forces with one of the top 10 philharmonic orchestras in the world - Tonhalle Zürich. Working with great care and innovation he has created a truly immersive audio-visual performance experience, combining a mesmerising integration of electronic and classical instrumentation, with a visual art installation based on breath taking nature landscapes shot from a helicopter perspective. With such an innovative approach he aims to bridge the gap between classical and electronic music and introduce a whole new generation to the neo-classical concept. / Sebastian's deep connection with music can be traced back to his formative years; from playing the organ and violin as a child, to performing in orchestras, string quartets and pop bands and progressing into electronic music in his late teens. Discovering house and techno in the mid- nineties was the catalyst behind a revolution in his life, he set out on a new musical pathway, to promote the simplicity of being. Throughout the late nineties he experimented with electronic sounds, forming cult duo Minilogue with a friend and releasing with Crosstown Rebels, Traum Schallplatten, Wagon Repair and more, plus two albums via Cocoon – ‘Animals’ (2008) and ‘Blomma’ (2013). In 2014, the duo decided to take a break and invest their time in solo projects and Sebastian has since been hard at work cultivating a collection of new music already snapped up by hugely influential labels such as R&S sub-label Apollo, Drumcode, Hypercolour and Minus. / Sebastian Mullaert’s live performances are awe-inspiring, combining technical wizardry with energy, atmosphere and euphoria, you only have to watch his “Interpretations” performance for XLR8R or Boiler Room appearance for examples of his prowess. Recognition of his aptitude has led him to perform at institutions and festivals such as Panorama Bar - Berlin, Labyrinth Festival - Japan, Fabric - London, Concrete - Paris, The Block - Tel Aviv and Blackmarket - NYC. / > / VRIL (Dystopian / Giegling / Delsin, Berlin) / Berlin-based Vril, amassed a following in 2011 when his track “UV” appeared on Marcel Fengler’s Berghain 05 compilation. He also garnered the attention of Marcel Dettmann in 2014 when he ended his fabric 77 mix with “Torus XXXII,” taken from Vril’s Torus LP. He has since continued to release music with Semantica and Giegling and brings his stunning live sets to venues across the world. /  / - - - - /  / 21+ | No Refunds | ATMs on site / Sound by Funktion-One (Official) / Stay connected: publicsf.com/connect","('37.7689950686633', '-122.419558579827')"

Before long he was playing his father’s vinyls and from here, quickly advanced to DJing and producing. / Initially producing drum & bass as well as trance, Nick Devon later transitioned his sound, gravitating towards electronica and techno.

As a former vinyl DJ, Nick is also an avid record collector and to this day, spins plenty of old and new records. /  / In 2010, Nick officially launched his solo project and started producing sounds and music that shook the dance floor, yet bestowed captivating melodies and emotional soundscapes, allowing people to create their own story within his productions. From this point forward, Nick’s career swiftly evolved. In 2015, he released two huge EP’s titled “The Poem” and “Cosmos”. His remix on Innellea - Colante quickly followed in 2016 and with all three EP’s released on Steyoyoke Recordings, it clearly affirmed just why he is considered a core member of the Berlin based collective.

Building on the early success of releases like the Sunrise EP on InFiné, the first releases on Fist or Finger (the label he co­runs with fabric’s Craig Richards) and the summer anthem that was ‘Twilight’ with vocalist Terri Walker on More Music, jozif was unsurprisingly snapped up by LA’s suitably sultry Culprit records for a brace of EPs. Here he further refined his richly musical style with genre defying with releases like ‘Standard Rising’, the ‘Lady B’ EP and now the two­part Waikiki anthem. / Since then he has been enlisted by the cultured likes of Mobilee, Suol and Compost for remixes, and the way he carefully permeates his music with such serene and slo­-mo ambiance yet imbues each track with a cheeky dance floor bump has seen everyone from Sasha to Giles Peterson, Andrew Weatherall to Damian Lazarus fall in love. / Having been a DJ since as far back as 1996, it made sense that the legendary Balance series came calling for jozif when they wanted to kick­off a new mix series in early 2013. What he turned in was a stunningly emotional and heartfelt mix that proved just how sensitive and soothing electronic music can be, at the same time, of course, as subtly making you move your body. For proof of his artistic ability in the booth, you only need ask anyone who has seen him play at places like Space Ibiza, Verboten New York & London’s foremost fabric and many other festivals around Asia and both Americas. / Currently putting the final touches to his debut artist album and accompanying Live show, whilst simultaneously Co­writing the Kerb Staller debut album & Live show alongside cohort and production partner Matt Tolfrey, 2016 is shaping up to be a ‘Live’ one. Coupled with releases on Music for Freaks, Exploited and the resurgence of Fist or Finger, as well his continued world wide residencies at Bedrock & Desert Hearts – jozif shows no signs of slowing down. /  / Ray and Nikita: / Ray Zuniga! /  / Label owner, producer, record selector, and gentleman of the LIVING night.

Their events started as an underground in Brooklyn, and they’ve taken the brand to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Europe for Amsterdam Dance Event for the past two years. In 2018, WeArePulse declared LIVING as one of the best events of the week! / As Zuniga’s reputation continues to garner attention for the maturity of his sound coupled with an uncanny ability to create instantly accessible dancefloor vibes, he occupies a unique position in the musical ecosystem. Independent of any hip or hyped musical movements. With releases on Nervous Records, Leftroom, Culprit, Wolf + Lamb, Serkal, and his own Touch of Class, he is now working diligently in the studio on his solo and LIVING project, while also co-operating the Touch of Class Records label. An imprint dedicated to presenting timeless music appreciated by any connoisseur of sound. /  / Nikita Never Stops!  / On the same day Dolly Parton, Janis Joplin, Edgar Allan Poe, his mother and grandmother were born, so too did San Francisco DJ, NIKITA, begin his enchanted existence. As a young boy in Denver, Colorado, NIKITA's childhood was similar to that of other extraordinary creative youth; days filled with church and show choir, playing the piano, and dancing to his mother's R&B albums. From an early age, NIKITA always knew he wanted to be an entertainer. Then, in 1993, a chance encounter with house music at an underground warehouse party would prove to be a pivotal moment in his life, ultimately guiding NIKITA towards the charmed life he lives today. /  / It wasn't until the turn of the millennium though that NIKITA would leave his home in Colorado to search the clubs and warehouses of San Francisco for his destiny. At the very least, he would get a degree in Music Business from San Francisco State University. But with a resounding perseverance and an inimitable personality, NIKITA quickly earned his place among the upper echelon of DJs in San Francisco's world-renowned club scene. In 2005, NIKITA was chosen to host his own radio show, The Massive Mix, on Northern California's only electronic dance music radio station, Energy 92.7 FM. Indeed, it was NIKITA's penchant for blending raw grooves with sophisticated sounds that garnered him a residency at San Francisco's legendary nightclub, The EndUp. Today NIKITA credits SF as the city that made him the adult and artist that he is today... / NIKITA is a DJ's DJ, a rare soul who truly understands his role in the DJ booth. Performing anywhere from two to eighteen hour sets, NIKITA weaves music into fantastic journeys of rhythm and sound. NIKITA's ability to contrast the harder elements of techno with the soulful sensuality of deep house has garnered him accolades from some of the world's best DJs and allowed him the rare opportunity to tag team alongside the likes of Cassy, Danny Howells, Lee Burridge, and Derek Plaslaiko. Indeed, NIKITA has played with a Who's Who of international talent, including Danny Tenaglia, M.A.N.D.Y., Joel Mull, Adam Beyer, Craig Richards, Steve Bug, Damian Lazurus, Steve Lawler, and many, many more. With additional inspiration coming from friends such as Ms. Honey Dijon, Tedd Patterson and Danny Tenaglia, it comes as no wonder why NIKITA's story is one of a dream come true. /  / Today, NIKITA and music partner, RAY ZUNIGA (Co-founder and label owner of ​Touch of Class Records​), produce an international music experience called LIVING.us. Their events started as an underground in Brooklyn, and they’ve taken the brand to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Europe for Amsterdam Dance Event for the past two years. In 2018, WeArePulse declared LIVING as one of the best events of the week! /  / COLE ODIN (DAS SIND WIR RECORDINGS) / Cole Odin Berggren IS music. When not singing, programming, and drumming for his electronic rock band, Ownership, he can be found DJing some of the best clubs in SF and beyond. Known for sets that feature a wide variety of styles, programmed with a musician's ear, and showcasing DJ skills honed over 20 years, Cole has played such bay area clubs as Housepitality, Ruby Sky, Mezzanine, the Virgin Hotel, Phonobar, Great Northern, Public Works, the SF Eagle and Monarch, where he currently holds a monthly residency on 1st Saturdays. He's played legendary clubs and parties like LIT and APT in NYC, and in LA he's played such notable gigs as the DO OVER, and the rooftop of the Standard Hotel. He's been booked several times to play the Sunset Campout Music Festival, arguably California's coolest music festival. Some of his corporate clients include Tesla Motors, Levi's, Puma, Stanford University, and LIVE NATION! which has him in rotation as the VIP room DJ at The Masonic, and in the poster room at The Fillmore. He also played the opening night party in Super Bowl 50's Super City, with a classic rock set opening for Chris Isaak in front of 6,000 people. His extensive musical background has led to other employment such as session drummer and vocalist, blog-writer for Monster Headphones, Om Records and Stunner of the Month, and music director/head music writer for SEX+DESIGN magazine, where he put his musical knowledge to work planning and DJing huge events, and interviewing artists such as Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins, Cody Chesnutt, Public Enemy, Pillow Talk, Matthew Dear and many more. By day, he also works as the outreach director for Blue Bear School of Music (the longest running non-profit rock n roll music school in the nation), where he runs after-school programs for kids, organizes their events, and created their DJ and Electronic Music Program. /  / *** / The Great Northern | 119 Utah St. / 21+ / Void Sound System /  / Follow The Great Northern on social media: / www.facebook.com/thegreatnorthernSF / www.instagram.com/greatnorthernsf","('37.7676612', '-122.4065246')"

Nebakaneza and Johnny 5 were just two random DJs who were obsessed with music of all kinds, but what brought them together was their love of Dubstep, and bass heavy music. They met online after hyping each other up, because they listened to each other’s mixes so much. They got a gig together one night at a tiny club in Oakland, and everyone there seemed to think their music was too weird. It didn’t matter to them though. They immediately became close friends, and eventually brothers. They formed a partnership and decided to start throwing their own weird events in San Francisco that would cater to other like minded weirdos. They worked their asses off, and just kept booking more and more of their favorite weirdos. What started in a gritty hole in the wall in 2010, blossomed into the biggest reoccurring bass event in the country.  /  / Ritual has hosted over 200 events, booked nearly 600 artists, and at our peak had up to 700 attendees every week. We expanded into LA, worked with festivals, threw big off-shoot events, and collaborated with many other major promoters. This party has always been fueled by the people who attend it, and we have been insanely lucky by our amazing crowd who became our friends over the years. There were never any fights at Ritual, and although scenes come with their share of dramas, our crowd has always been all about the music. We kept our events affordable so nearly everyone had access, and we learned everyone’s name because we had genuine conversations and experiences. You all became our family. We never had a separate line for guest list because we never wanted anyone to feel less important than anyone else. Without you, we are nothing, and we are excited to re-capture that magic once again. /  / RITUAL ROOM: / Antiserum: / https://soundcloud.com/antiserum / Gladkill: / https://soundcloud.com/gladkill / Nebakaneza / https://soundcloud.com/nebakaneza / Johnny 5: / https://soundcloud.com/Johnny5dubstep / Elevener: / https://soundcloud.com/elvnrstep / Filthgrinder: / https://soundcloud.com/filthgrinder / White Gravy: / https://soundcloud.com/white_gravy /  / 2ND ROOM (House/Bass): / Switchblade: / https://soundcloud.com/187switchblade / Danny Weird: / https://soundcloud.com/dannyweird / Mr. Brandon: / https://soundcloud.com/mrbrandon / Sneakerz: / https://soundcloud.com/dothedaft5555 / Nightware: / https://soundcloud.com/nightwarez /  / Bootie Room with Hubba Hubba  / (Onesie Night) / John Beaver: / https://soundcloud.com/djjohnbeaver / Adrian A: / http://bootiemashup.com/ / and more /  / Hip Hop Lounge (hosted by Bootie DJs) / DJs TBA /  / Our entrance will be through the smaller door, to the left of DNA Pizza.

The powerhouse sister-labels both went on to feature a total of 5 of the aspiring American’s productions as standout moments in their chart-topping and legendary compilation albums in Anjunadeep 9 & 10 and most recently, Anjunabeats vol. 14. /  / In early 2019, the musician announced a brand change, citing complications with the name ‘Fairchild’. In an open statement, he genuinely explained the struggles he’s had and reassured fans that the branding changes would have no impact on his sound or style, stating “I’m still making whatever music I would have made as Fairchild. It’s still me in the studio, only now, I have a new name and brand I can call my own. It’s something I 100% believe in and can feel confident operating in for years to come.” /  / The highly-anticipated alias reveal was met with excitement and interest from fans and industry professionals alike. When asked how he came up with the name, he mysteriously responded that he felt like ‘Nox Vahn’ chose him, and not the other way around. /  / He would go on to perform at some of the most legendary venues in the United States including Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado, and the Brooklyn Mirage in New York; while supporting names like Kaskade, Above & Beyond, and Lane 8 on tour; and continuing to see highly successful releases on labels such as Kaskade’s Arkade, and London based powerhouse label, Anjunadeep. /  / Clearly, Nox has proven himself worthy of a seat at the underground table. He has vowed to continue to explore the depths of his mind and electronic music - and with his heavy progressive influence and signature dark sound, he will continue to win the hearts and minds of people around the world - a shining beacon calling out to all of those who will listen /  / ABOUT SIMON DOTY: / Over the last six years, Simon Doty has become one of the most prolific producers on the scene. Working with imprints such as Einmusika, Stil vor Talent, Sincopat, and Steyoyoke; Simon has pushed the boundaries of his sound while also becoming a staple in the touring circuit. Over the years, Simon has seen heavy support from the likes of Solomun, Maceoplex, Sasha, Henry Saiz, Elke Kljein, Laurent Garnier, Agoria, Stephan Bodzin, Oliver Koletzki, and Olivier Giaccomotto.

A year later came the release which marked a milestone for Perfect Stranger – “Changed” – a remix CD which gave rise to some of the most epic tunes which still reign dancefloors today. The release of “Free Cloud” in 2008 took the Perfect Stranger sound to its peak and made its mark on the scene with a unique psy-tech sound that had been unprecedented before. /  / From here on, the Perfect Stranger sound had it’s distinctive soundscape and a genre within it’s own.

Under these aliases you’ll find sweeping emotive cuts, verdantdancefloor workouts and discerning dips into jungle and breaks. Releaseshave come on respected labels including Meda Fury, Ectotherm, UN.T.O andLobster Fury: the collaborative label from Lobster Theremin and Meda Furybegun for the explicit purpose of releasing his tracks.DJ Seinfeld’s beats are ultimately guided by an idea of authenticity, true to thespirit of the early house pioneers and the unabashed rawness the confines oftheir equipment demanded. A lot’s been made of this lo-fi fuzz, with manyclamoring to declare it a scene, but he won’t be put into a box. His path is hisown. A microphone picks up the tension and release of a singer: charged withemotion, the machine can’t handle it. The rough edges of his productions emitthe same sensibility.Footage of his gigs or their post-show reaction exemplifies the reception hegets as a DJ. Biographies often claim a DJ regularly ‘sends crowds intorapture’ or ‘lays waste to the floor,’ but in DJ Seinfeld’s case pandemonium isthe default. Mixes show his deft control of build-up and feel in the booth, whilehis mini series for legendary London station Rinse FM in May ‘DJ Seinfeldpresents…’, was a master class in the kind of wonky left-field house hepeppers his sets with.Armand began making music in Edinburgh at the suggestion of a respectedfriend. Time spent experimenting with sounds and exploring the possibilitiescontained within his laptop was cathartic relief from the grind of finishing hisstudies. Later returning to his hometown of Malmo, his interest in makingmusic would intensify thanks to encouragement from his old school friendsand the looming spectre of a 9-5 lifestyle. A move to Barcelona and the end ofa relationship resulted in extended sessions watching the classic Americansitcom and the music made to reflect that appeared under the name DJSeinfeld.Rimbaudian already had traction and DJ Seinfeld was really intended as aside-project to exorcise emotions felt at that time. At first, tracks appeared onmusic-sharing groups online but he didn’t claim ownership, despite thegrowing buzz. When his friend Courtesy’s label Ectotherm began asking whothe mysterious producer was, he began to take note. Then before long,Lobster Theremin and Media Fury followed suit.The point of no return though came one evening spent with Ableton and a fewbeers. The track ‘U’ was uploaded to Soundcloud, and the internet went intooverdrive. Sampling Bob Geldoff’s account of his split with his wife, amidsoaring chants and keys wrought in heartache, ‘U’ is almost voyeuristic in itshonesty. It’s that truth, that realness, that defines what Armand’s music isabout.","('37.7676612', '-122.4065246')"

With a hypnotic and emotionally charged style that blends early 2000s progressive with house grooves and elements of contemporary techno, Khen possesses a truly idiosyncratic sound that transcends genre. /  / Going back to when it at all began, Khen immersed himself in the world of dance music at an early age under the tutelage of his older brother. When not busy learning how to play the piano, 6-year-old Khen mixed records using two cassette decks. When he stood before a set of Technics 1210s for the first time, he was yet to blow out the candles on the day of his 9th birthday. /  / He was also gifted with an almost unsettling production talent and was encouraged to start spending time in the studio at age 11. Instantly spellbound by the process, he spent all his spare time in front of a Moog synth instead of the playground. A buzz amongst the house and techno faithfuls in Tel Aviv started building, and the scene began to yearn for the young prodigy to showcase his productions on a dance floor. He obliged and ended up playing his debut club show at merely 15 at Tel Aviv’s legendary Dome venue. /  / After years of honing his skills both in the studio and behind the decks, his music hit the ears of Guy Mantzur in 2011, who promptly signed him to his Plattenbank imprint. Proving to become a catalyst event, the then 22-year-old Khen regained his determination to pursue music. Since then he has released on labels in the likes of Nick Warren’s Hope, Hernan Cattaneo’s Sudbeat, Guy J’s Lost & Found, Jeremy Olander’s Vivrant, John Digweed’s Bedrock and microCastle. /  / On the club end, the most coveted DJ booths in the world he once yearned to stand in are now his second home. With his allure growing beyond the shores of his home country in recent years, he has visited revered venues in the likes of Bahrein, Sound, Monochrome, Ministry of Sound, Pacha, Chips, Halcyon, Schimanski, Silver & Smoke and more. /  / He saw his international breakthrough in 2016 when he released his critically acclaimed debut album ”One Day of Independence” on Guy J’s Lost & Found. The LP saw support from the likes of Pete Tong, Noir, Dubfire, Joris Voorn, Hernan Cattaneo, Jeremy Olander, Paco Osuna and made the coveted number 1 spot on the overall releases chart in mere days. /  / Khen started 2017 with a debut US tour at Schimanski in New York City, Sound in Los Angeles and Halycon in San Fransisco and released massive debut EPs on Vivrant and Bedrock. Infinite praise from industry institutions such as DJ Mag and Mixmag followed, and it was no surprise the influential Dancing Astronaut named him an ”Artist to watch in 2017” alongside Yotto, ANNA and Enrico Sangiuliani. Mixmag opted to feature him in their “Impact” segment that highlights high momentum talent and has previously played host to budding superstars Lauren Lo Song, Cristoph, Peggy Gou and Julia Govor to name a few. /  / With this in mind, there’s no wonder that he caught UK legend John Digweed’s eyes and ears. ”Baby Steps” was Khen’s debut on Digweed’s power house label Bedrock, and you can surely have a worse coming out party on a new label. Two of the three tracks cracked the overall Beatport Top 100 and stayed at the top of the charts for weeks and left the Bedrock fan base longing for more. /  / Going from strength to strength in 2017 with a lot more to bring to the table, all signs point to 2018 becoming an even bigger year for Khen. With an arsenal of remixes on Noir, Bedrock and originals on Lost & Found as well as other unnamed labels, the crown is there for the taking for this phenom pegged as the next big thing.","('37.766752', '-122.402438')"

Kenji’s DJ style is characterised by unmistakable romantic, spacey, and eclectic selection from his famously extensive record collection. His label Crue-L Records has been at the forefront of Japanese alternative music since its inception 28 years ago. From his remixes of Nina Kraviz, Cornelius,Hiroshi Fujiwara,Sebastien Tellier, Cut Copy, Phil Manzanera (Roxy Music),Dimitri From Paris, Boris and countless more, to his studio work with dance favourites Theo Parrish, DJ Harvey and many more. /  / EUG (Public Release | SF) / https://soundcloud.com/eug /  / Under the unofficial tagline “A label for music, culture and home to degenerates”, San Francisco based independent record label Public Release Recordings was founded by Eugene “Eug” Whang in 2009. The label was launched as a platform for music produced by Eug’s immediate circle of friends, and although eight years on the scope is now unmistakably international, that sense of community remains. The discography, which by the end of 2019 will comprise of 21 releases, features more than 20 contributing artists including Soulwax, Tim Sweeney, Jacques Renault, Earth Boys, Mark E, Velvet Season & The Hearts of Gold, Eric Duncan and Force of Nature. There is no definitive sound attached to the label, but rather each release is carried out as a focussed individual project, receiving its own distinct direction and treated with the utmost care and attention to detail. A long time DJ, Eug took on the role of “party promoter” due to not finding the exact party he wanted to frequent. He would start the party FACE in 2007, aiming to bridge the gap between San Francisco’s bar and club scenes. After outgrowing its small dive bar origins, Eug moved the party into larger club venues where he has hosted notables such as DJ Harvey, James Murphy, Massive Attack, 2Many DJ’s, Jamie XX, Daniele Baldelli and many more. Regardless of the size and nature of the venue, the music policy has always been about mixing things up and offering plenty of variety. This philosophy of musical diversity and anything goes, would eventually birth the FACE party mantra - “Its not a genre, it's a feeling”. /  / JEREMY CASTILLO (Club Lonely | SF) / https://soundcloud.com/jeremy_castillo /  / Club Lonely resident, Soo Wavey familia, and all around house fiend, Jeremy Castillo plays house the way it's meant to be heard -- loud. With a nod to the classic midwestern house sound, the SF native beats up the dance floor with everything from classic to contemporary jacking house, NJ/NY garage, intimate italo disco vocal cuts, and hidden gems awaiting the right moment of the evening.

However it was taken; their approach achieved the group multiple successes early on, launching the project with a momentum that continues today. /  / ————————————————————————————— /  / So Stoked for Love 2020 /  / DNA Lounge  / 375 Eleventh Street  / San Francisco, CA /  / Tickets online: / $10-$20 presale at:  / http://bit.ly/SS4Love2020Tickets /  / Door: $25 before 9pm; $30 after.  /  / Join the monkeys group for $5 off additional discount! / Wear kandi for $5-$10 discount or get in free with a 3D cuff BIGGER (Wider AND Taller) than your head!! /  / Parking: huge garage across the street plus street parking /  / Coat check: yes / Pizza joint: yes /  / All Ages / Full bars for 21+ / 7 PM—LATE /  / Kandi Love Vibe /  / ————————————————————————————— /  / Kandi Discount!  / Get $5 off at the door if you arrive with kandi fully covering both arms up to your elbows, $10 off if you arrive with both arms fully covered up to your shoulders, or get in FREE with a 3D cuff bigger than your head!! /  / ————————————————————————————— /  / No Treble Harm Reduction is a peer-to-peer harm reduction organization that promotes health and safety within all music and nightlife communities. /  / At events you can observe us checking on attendee's well-being making sure that everyone is safe.

He's explored ancient music in remote regions of Namibia, Australia, Mexico and Louisiana and now lives an itinerant life not confined to four dimensions. “His solo work is possessed of a lonesome spark, exaggerating the implied drone at the heart of the music of Dock Boggs and The Stanley Brothers... playing wooden six-string banjo, violin, accordion and kalimba, his voice has a high, eerie quality... extremely psychedelic"" -(David Keenan, The Wire UK) / https://ralphewhite.com/music /  / Junior Mint Prince / Extracting holy sounds from the god of the gut, Lula Asplund and Naomi Harrison-Clay play as if all the world, and all that is hidden by the world, is open to their grasp.

Junior Mint Prince doesn't reach in order to transcend the vortex but to vascularize new paths within its churn, exposing new paths between the dense thicket of noise and the soft moment of having feet on the ground, embodying characters from the subconscious as the means to greet them at the door.

Far away from the glamour and glitter of Hollywood he cut his teeth growing up in a vibrant, diverse neighborhood and still draws inspiration from this cultural melting pot. It also remains the area where he and the Raíz brothers Vangelis and Vidal – who together founded the Droid Behavior events collective in the early 2000s – hang out and regularly plot their widely known and respected Interface warehouse events. /  / A classically trained musician in his youth, Moe came to circulate around the Noise, Punk and Industrial scene, playing guitar and singing in various bands until he discovered the early ’90s L.A. rave scene. He fell in love with this music and immediately dove deeper to find out how it was made. That was when he got in touch with some of the heroic synthesizers of Techno’s early years. His enthusiasm for those exciting, synthetic sounds was beyond words, and the following years he hardly left the studio of his day job to work on his own productions in a little back room at night. When he handed out his first self-produced, self-pressed vinyl’s at the Electronic Music Festival in Detroit and some of the DJs played his record the very next day on various stages, he was chuffed and ready to go all the way. /  / Even though he has become one of the more popular Techno artists in the North American scene, you can still hear his Industrial and Noise roots in everything he is doing. His debut album “Sleep Complex” – which was released on CLR – is characterized by a complete disregard for genre limitations and is everything but a conventional Techno album. Drumcell is a science-fiction-movies-loving technology geek with a Punk Rock soul, who has explored and discovered the analogue world as much as the digital world of music production, to finally combine them into his very own raw, suspenseful and hypnotic style. He is literarily addicted to analog synthesis and spends countless hours in his studio, ceaselessly experimenting and searching for new, mind-expanding sounds. /  / Drumcell has played at numerous prestigious venues worldwide, from Berlin´s Techno mecca Berghain to the main stage of the Movement festival in Detroit. His label Droid Recordings and his own releases have captured the attention of many of the world’s top Techno jocks. Drumcell has come full circle and is ready for a whole new chapter of what he is best at and what matters most to him in life – the manifestation of truthful emotions in futuristic sonic concepts.","('37.775296', '-122.410074')"

Mouracade's roots reach as far back as the Southern California punk scene that gave rise to an equally as rich underground club world in the 90s.

In the process, Alexandre got a severe addiction to buying records and finding old synths to record and learn from. / Mouracade's music and DJ sets reflect his passion for digging deep and not sticking to a specific genre - but by finding those tracks that have a timelessness to fit any moment on the dance floor. /  / Since 2012, Split Secs landed on various charts and track listings when the duo’s first EP “I’m Not Losin’” (Jolly Jams) earned heavy rotation worldwide.

As the Acid Test brand has grown Alex and Tyrel have been able to expand and bring the party to other cities, and have since been putting forth their efforts toward throwing more underground events outside the confines of nightclubs.","('42.0563058', '-71.4274316736134')"

We've been looking forward for this for a long while, but health comes first and we wish Luigi a fast recovery. Stay tuned for the make up date! Those of you that purchase tickets, feel FREE to request a refund!, , Agents Of Time","ABOUT AGENTS OF TIME  /  / Agents Of Time is the project of Andrea Di Ceglie, Fedele Ladisa and Luigi Tutolo. A revered three­man live act, DJs, masters of their sound in the studio and founders of the Obscura record label. / Since starting their journey together as Agents Of Time, the three Italians have combined their talents and shared influences to become a globally in­demand dance act, releasing on a number of leading labels along the way. A much­loved debut 12” on Correspondent in 2014, ‘Polina’, marked them out as an exciting new name in the realm of emotional, melodic techno and kickstarted their touring career. / A hardware­heavy, improvisational live set spanning house, techno and acid is at the heart of what they do. The three members perform around a square table, facing each other, translating a symbiotic energy through the machines and communicating through instinct and gesture. A complex, unique and unpredictable dance between human minds and analog equipment that invariably creates moments of magic. Their live set was partly inspired by an expert of the craft in Mathew Jonson, and it is telling of Agents Of Time’s success that they now count Jonson as a collaborator. ‘Repeating Patterns, Numbers and Letters’, Agents Of Time’s first studio collaboration with Jonson came out in March 2019, following live shows together at Rex Club (Paris) and Movement Festival (Torino). / Agents Of Time’s DJ set, for which the three members alternate to form a duo, allows them to express the same vision through a more eclectic medium. The adventurous spirit and heady sound palette is channeled into house, techno and more obscure selections. / Their work in the studio is a free­flowing ritual, an extension of what they do on stage. ‘Spread The Word’, their debut album came out Stem Records in 2014 and was followed by hit EPs for Maceo Plex’s Ellum Audio, their own label Obscura and Curle Recordings. A relationship with Tale Of Us and multiple appearances at Afterlife events has also led to Agents Of Time signing to Afterlife with the stunning ‘Dream Vision’ EP and 'Paradigm' on the Realm Of Consciousness compilation. / Perhaps the purest form of Agents Of Time’s music belongs to their own label Obscura. They inaugurated the label with the hypnotic, bassline wizardry of ‘Day One’ and in 2018 followed up with ‘Ordinary Cosmic Dance’. The label, which began as (and continues to be) a party series, has also provided a platform for like­minded artists through a double­vinyl compilation, and counts luminaries such as The Hacker, Antigone and Francois X amongst its roster. / The Agents Of Time are taking careful steps and showing themselves to be gifted, versatile performers with each one. Whether on record, on stage or at an Obscura event, count on a high­quality output, finely balanced between experimentation and a straight dancefloor vibe.","('37.7715452653061', '-122.413774183673')"

With strong connections to Damian Lazarus at Crosstown Rebels and the Afterlife crew, Ae:ther has considerable industry support with his focus on delivering high-quality dance floor ready cuts that channel his love for ambient electronica and transmitting deep emotion, while keeping the energy levels high. /  / Ae:ther discovered club music early in his life, inspired by Underground Resistance and the early Detroit sound, along with artists like Autechre, Brian Eno, Tangerine Dream and Miles Davis - pioneers who pushed boundaries. As producing and DJing became a daily obsession, he left Rome to go and study in Milan. It was there, at the Istituto Europeo di Design (IED) that he studied Sound Design and his lifelong commitment to the exploration of sound and vibration really took hold. /  / From there he moved to London, a city where he matured and grew as an artist. After a couple of years he found a space at Fortress Studios in Old Street, where he befriended neighbours such as Bicep and assisted other artists with their music, his knowledge of sound design giving him the ability to add a whole other dimension to the artists he worked with. Six years in London gave Ae:ther all the experience he needed of life in a city that many consider to be the centre of the musical universe. /  / In 2017, enticed by the prospect of expanding his network and pushing his career forwards Ae:ther moved to Berlin. There he joined like-minded collaborators Mind Against and Tale Of Us, alongside a whole crew of new friends, and immersed himself in the highly fertile electronic music scene. The Berlin lifestyle; liberal, inclusive and supportive of the arts, has fed back into Ae:ther’s love for production, and taken him to a whole new level of musical expression. /  / As a producer he has been blazing a trail, his natural aptitude for crafting emotive, captivating compositions landing him several releases with Afterlife, including his exceptional EP ‘Spectre’, which was released in July 2018. Ae:ther’s love for experimental, ambient music lies at the core of his distinct sound. Coupled with deep underground influences and a meditative atmosphere, he programs taut percussion and juxtaposes it with dreamlike soundscapes, telling mesmerising stories with his synths. /  / This inimitable approach has brought him to the attention of one of the scene’s most influential figures, Damian Lazarus. He has commissioned Ae:ther to compose a remix of his exceptional single ‘All I Need’ with the Ancient Moons and has also signed his debut album. Another release with Afterlife is also scheduled for mid-2019. Besides that, Ae:ther has performed across Europe and is preparing to unleash his debut live set. A dazzling culmination of hours and hours spent on painstaking production and curation, the hour-long live show will showcase a wide range of Ae:ther’s largely unreleased productions; demonstrating his diversity and unparalleled talent. /  / At the birth of electronic music its visionary pioneers wanted to soundtrack the future, now that future is here it’s artists like Ae:ther who take up the mantle and guide us into the unknown. As part of the new vanguard he is perfectly poised to do just that, so strap yourself in and prepare to be transported into the next century.","('37.7809734', '-122.4084801')"

For the Helliker-Hales brothers in Chaos In The CBD, it’s strictly a family thing. They may well be one of the hottest propositions in the current house firmament, but they’ve still managed to maintain the homespun vibe that comes from growing up in the idyllic suburbs of Auckland. /  / These days the duo – Louis and Ben (aka Beans) – are part of the tight knit Peckham dance community, but the chill summers of New Zealand’s North Island still hold a place in their fertile imagination. Having been schooled in the wares of bands like The Cure and Joy Division from their music-mad parents, it’s now the boys turning them onto house music and, yes, John Tejada. /  / Having built a reputation in the studio and followed it up with the constant rigours of the DJ touring life, they’re now ready to take stock, step back and examine where they want to be in ten years rather than the afterparty in three hours. They’ve taken the big step from having a laugh to building a career. “Plans?,” queries Louis. “We’ve got our own label and we invest a lot in that. It means we can release stuff at a rate which we want to. We also have a two tracker for Mule Musiq but then going forward, it's kind of open waters, though we do want to start working with outside labels again, it can be a bit of an echo chamber recording for yourself.” The label in question is their venture in tandem with fellow Kiwi Jon Sable, In Dust We Trust, which has so far yielded a sterling set of releases between the trio. /  / Kornél Kovács / — / Born 1985 in Stockholm to Hungarian parents, Kornél Kovács' perambulations in music began early and have continued at pace ever since. Raised on that classic, enviable diet of “proper” music training plus parents with killer music taste, Kovács' daytime lessons were given texture at night as everything from Kraftwerk and Art Of Noise to King Tubby and Boogie Down Productions wafted through the house. /  / Applying the Stakhanovite work ethic of his heritage to all he had learned so far, Kovács started knocking on as many of Stockholm's musical doors as possible, teaboying in the city's finest record stores, stalking its best DJs, working his way through the local library's excellent selection of dance music records. Kovács, then a “clumsy nerd who got to hang around the older cool kids because they found me funny”, even managed to wangle a few DJ gigs on the back of an intense early teenage love of mid-90s drum'n'bass, turning him into “Stockholm's youngest former jungle DJ” by the age of 14. /  / After a few years in this exquisitely premature retirement, Kovács picked his headphones up again in the mid-00s, and exciting things followed. Kovács had always written about music, and this, which he did for his own mp3 blog and various culture and music magazines, was joined by a DJ residency at Stockholm's legendary Paradise night, as well as a weekly radio show on P3, Sweden's Radio 1 equivalent. An unsurprisingly important stint at Red Bull Music Academy in 2008 was followed by the formation of Studio Barnhus with his best friends Axel Boman and Petter Nordkvist. At first a studio space and DJ trio, and a year later a record label, Studio Barnhus has now charted 50 releases and counting – the initial Good Children Make Bad Grown Ups EP was Kovács' first appearance on vinyl. /  / The collective's successes have drawn reams of prestigious press coverage in the years since and worldwide DJ dates for its three members, as well as giving Kovács the artistic space that eventually fostered 2014's Szikra, the track Kovács admits was what made him realise he could “actually make music that people appreciate”. Given all this, it would be wrong to describe last year's Pantalón, on Glasgow's Numbers imprint, as any kind of “breakout” moment. Its irresistible, snapping drums and Spanish-language vocal did get people talking and dancing though, while an appearance on Hamburg's esteemed Smallville imprint in the same year saw him connect with another of Europe's electronic music powerhouses. /  / Kovács' debut album, The Bells, is out on Studio Barnhus in August and was recorded during an intensive two-week session in Gothenburg with his great friend (and great studio engineer) Matt Karmil. Giving your debut LP the same name as the most influential techno track in history certainly takes balls. But after hearing how the album draws together Kovács' natural festive musicality and his long-standing love of club rhythmics, and then factoring in the juggernaut trajectory that's taken him from tea-making record store jester to globally acclaimed producer and DJ, you can certainly forgive his confidence. /  / Baltra / — / Fusing subtle fizzing beats, gently whirring melodies, engulfing atmospheres and tracks that weave between dance floor euphoria and isolated headphone listening, Baltra explores the depths and nuances of electronic music.","('37.7676612', '-122.4065246')"

They met online after listening to each other’s mixes. They got a gig together one night at a tiny club in Oakland, and everyone there seemed to think their music was too weird. It didn’t matter to them though. They immediately became close friends, and eventually brothers. They formed a partnership and decided to start throwing their own weird events in San Francisco that would cater to other like minded weirdos. They worked their butts off, and just kept booking more and more of their favorite weirdos. What started in a gritty hole in the wall in 2010, blossomed into the biggest reoccurring bass event in the country.  /  / Ritual has hosted over 200 events, and booked nearly 600 artists.

Jaxx /  / DJ, Producer, Event Curator, Entrepreneur, and Founder of Les Play House, J. Jaxx, has progressively become one of the Bay Area's most prominent names when it comes to music and the community in which it attracts. With an ambiguous style, and versatility in House, Disco, Funk, Hip-Hop, R&B, and Electronic music, it's J. Jaxx's willingness to take risk with sound that has led him to transcend from small venues around the city, to major clubs in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego, and San Jose, playing alongside artists such as George Clinton, Jacquees, Sam Gellaitry, Noodles, Soulection's Andre Power, Sasha Marie, SoSuperSam, Jared Jackson, and Sango, Goldie Award winning turntablist Miles Medina, recording artist Freddie Gibbs, and most notably Stone Throw Records affiliated producer, Madlib. /  / Remaining one step ahead with a trusted ear for what's next, J. Jaxx paired his experience, craftsmanship, and hospitality, to execute his own event, Les Play House. A rare experience dedicated solely to the sounds of House, Disco, and Funk, Les Play House provides an atmosphere that re-introduces event-goers to a genre first celebrated among DJ's and producers alike. Debuting with a sold out show in San Francisco, J. Jaxx quickly recognized its demand, and expanded beyond its hometown by taking the show across the West Coast. / Whether on stage or behind the scenes, it's the attention to detail that will continue to translate into every project J. Jaxx attaches himself to, and remain important when it comes to putting forth only the best for a crowd that continues to show appreciation. /  / + /  / BZAR /  / BZAR has made a name for himself as a producer and DJ in places beyond his home of the Bay Area.

3367,3/27/2020,Cancelled /// Phonobar presents: Trus'me,Phonobar,sanfrancisco,us,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1401813,20:00 - 02:00,370 Grove Street,$,21+,Phonobar,Trus'me,"With his love for music tracing way back to an early age by dabbling with various instruments and then moving on to develop a passion for record collecting, Trus’me found his calling after learning the art of mixing and sample digging. Surrounded by the heads of Manchester and its deep rooted music scene, one couldn’t deny that it was an effortless task to be exposed to good music from all genres, thus explaining his constantly evolving tastes as evident in his eclectic DJ sets as well as in his uniquely, diverse productions. “Like bookends some 12’s will work with both the beginning and the end of the night, such is the classy sampling from Trus’me” (Peter Nicholson, XLR8R). /  / The much reputed CD sampler “Nards” that was responsible for initialing releases on Chicago’s Still Music label, inevitably sparked off Trus’me’s promising musical career. Seeing support from respected names such as Ashley Beedle, Juan Atkins, Mad Matts, Gilles Peterson and Chez Damier plus his productions selling out at record stores from Manchester to Tokyo, led to the highly successful release of his debut album, “Working Nights”, on Fat City Recordings, that’s hailed by most to be a timeless album, still finding devotees to this day. /  / Not one to rest on his laurels, the label Prime Numbers was set up and quickly gained an unfaltering reputation for highly collectable and exceptional music from artistes such as Move D, Actress, Linkwood, Fudge Fingas, Motorcity Drum Ensemble; all artistes that fit the ethos and style that Trus’me continues to carry a torch for. In 2009, his highly anticipated follow-up album, “In The Red” that featured the likes of Chez, Damier, Amp Fiddler and Dam Funk further cemented his place in the House scene and set off a flurry remixes for acts such as LCD Soundsystem, Motor City Drum Ensemble, Alton Miller, Anthony Shake Shakir and more, including non-stop touring to clubs and festivals alike in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, North America, South America and of course, in his backyard, the city of Manchester where it all began. /  / Keeping up with his rough release rate of one new album every couple of years, Prime Numbers label boss Trus’me is back in 2016 with his fourth full length, Planet 4. Featuring nine cuts of intergalactic techno, it once again marks a considerable sonic evolution for the acclaimed UK artist. The latest album is a vehicle for his own interest in deep space, physics and dark matter. It is those subjects that have occupied his mind in recent years, and those subjects that inform this brilliantly otherworldly album. Where previous LPs have variously been funk and soul heavy, or openly analogue and physical, this one is a more subtle and supple techno affair that is as cerebral as it is seductive.","('42.0563058', '-71.4274316736134')"

Her dance-inflected experimental music investigates the nature of humanity in the digital age—including her 2019 album PROTO, made in part with artificial intelligence. Drawing from folk traditions of East Tennessee, Berlin’s radical club culture, and her Stanford graduate studies on machine learning and music, Herndon’s complex and riveting music promises a unique live performance. /  / Since her arrival in 2012, Holly Herndon has successfully mined the edges of electronic and Avant Garde pop and emerged with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. Born in the mountains of East Tennessee, she went from singing in church to enrolling in a German exchange program. Adopting Berlin as a second home, she cut her teeth performing in the city’s clubs prior to attending Mills College. She utilized the laptop as “the most intimate instrument,” cultivating live voice processing systems and developing custom vocal patches to construct experimental pieces performed in real-time. She put those pieces into play on the likes of 'Breathe' and 'Dilato' from her full-length debut, Movement.  /  / Researching platform politics for her phD at Stanford, she assembled her 2015 sophomore offering Platform. Telematic performance at Stanford fueled 'DAO' and integrated custom sampling of daily activities online into the songcraft of 'Chorus' and 'Home'. As it sparked commentary on “platform politics”, Platform closed out 2015 by gracing year-end lists from Pitchfork, The Guardian, NME, and The Wire. Primarily composed alongside collaborators online, it was “the first commercially released album to include a track intended to trigger autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR).” Following the release, Radiohead handpicked her to open up its European tour.  /  / In 2019, she broke ground again on her third full-length, PROTO. She fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and A.I. voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN says Holly is “shaping the future of A.I.” as she operates at the nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis. /  / Tickets: http://grayarea.org/event/holly-herndon/","('37.754435755102', '-122.41854744898')"

A defining record of the mid 90s which set Nightmares on Wax on their own musical trajectory, Nightmares main man George Evelyn will be rekindling his much-loved downbeat blend of soul, hip-hop, dub and timeless club sounds, start to finish, with a full orchestrated live show next year. /  / He says “It’s amazing that i’m talking about my album Smoker Delight 25 years later! To say this will be an honour to perform this album live in its entirety at this point in my life right now, is an understatement. I’ve had so many incredible experiences from releasing music throughout my career, but let me share the fact that this album changed my life and opened me up to new opportunities of how I could produce music going forward. I am forever grateful for this moment in my life, bringing this back to the stage with such a special live show is going to be delightful on many levels.” /  / Smokers Delight was one of a handful of records to define a generation along with Massive Attack’s Blue Lines, Portishead’s Dummy and Tricky’s Maxinquaye. It took George Evelyn from his electronic-genre-blending debut 1991’s A Word of Science, into releasing the iconic downtempo, soul and hip hop material for which he has become renowned. Music lovers from around the world were intoxicated by this bassy, afterhours sound that became the backdrop to a million late-night living room sessions. Smokers Delight managed to capture that feeling and add a dash of light to the darkness, changing the musical landscape for Nightmares and the still young Warp label forever. /  / Evelyn’s recent output includes the critically and commercially acclaimed Nightmares on Wax Back to Mine compilation, released earlier this year, which saw him take the helm of the compilation for its 20th Anniversary, and his long-awaited eighth album Shape The Future [2018]. Energized by a recent run of globetrotting DJ sets, including residencies in Ibiza and London, Nightmares on Wax’s return will also hold some surprises.

Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.","('37.778427', '-122.418057')"

By taking rare disco classics and stripping them down and rebuilding them to a beating perfection it's no wonder why his imprint Grimy sells out worldwide. /  / Zernell was born in Chicago and started DJing at the age of 14. This was during the early years of house music and like a lot of Chicago teens he religiously listened to the Hot Mix 5 on WBMX. Zernell musically grew up in the Music Box and other Chicago clubs listening to the sounds of Ron Hardy and other early pioneers of house music and was schooled by the masters in the art of song selection and timing that drives dancers into a frenzy. Zernell’s Grimy style of music features some of the hottest and rarest house & disco songs and re-edits mixed just the right way to keep you dancing and wanting more, which has made Zernell one of the hottest dj’s in the underground scene today. /  / Zernell has done numerous parties in cities around the globe. He has toured the U.K. and Europe and headlined parties in London, The Netherlands,  / Italy, Sweden, France, Switzerland & Germany. Zernell’s passion for disco & house is as strong as it was in the 80’s and reflects in his extensive record collection of rare vinyl. Out of that passion Zernell created the label Grimy Edits, which have sold thousands of units worldwide. /  / Zernell Gillie's style can range from the heart of disco to the soul of Chicago house with a grimy twist. With over 30 years of Deejaying under his belt, it shows in all of his mixes & live performances. He heads the highly sought after record label Grimy Edits & the sister label Grimy Trax. He is the creator of the lifestyle brand Grimy Gear. He is the Co-founder of the Crate Diggers Record Fair & After-party series, and has a monthly show on NTS Radio LA. (“Get Grimy” w/Zernell) /  / Mark Quark / Succumbing to the influences of Industrial music, Acid House and Belgian New Beat, fresh young-hearted Mark Hanson’s alter ego and ambassador for shockingly good music Mark E. Quark was born at age eighteen. With a penchant for putting songs, beats, and lyrics together in ways that gave his listeners starry-eyes and loyal hearts, Mark E. Quark resolved to use his powers of DJ’ing only for good, not evil. However, he also resolved not to ever wear tights, a cape, or a mask at the same time so as to not focus on his superhero DJ status. Quark likes to keep the focus on the music. /  / ""With an ability to mesmerize audiences over Radio Waves, Internet Connections as well as any dance floor, Mark E. Quark has lit up audiences all over the world. He has played alongside (and counts among his fans) renowned producers and DJ’s Doc Martin, Derrick L. Carter, Lil Louie Vega, Kenny Hawkes, Gemini, Onionz, Dan Ghenacia, Ivan Smagghe, Juan Atkins, Hipp-E, Justin Harris, Phil Weeks, Hector Morales Mark Farina, the Wicked crew, Halo, Richard James (Aphex Twin) and Moby. /  / Mark E. Quark’s handwriting can be seen undeniably all over Southern California’s legendary nightlife scene. He was a pivotal force in the foundation of SOMA, Playskool, G-Force and gave assists to San Francisco heavyweight events The Gathering, Basics, By the People's Out Of Sight parties, Stompy Dig In, and Sunset. Quark’s also caused major foot-stomping with his own releases on Hi-Phen (Belgium), Camouflage (US) & Facade (US). /  / ""In a pinch, if forced to employ adjectives to describe the Mark E. Quark style, one would come up with words like “groovy, laid back and nasty” house music. But putting grammar aside, it’s reasonable to just say that Quark has internalized influences from DJ Harvey, Idjut Boys, Jeno + early Andrew Weatherall, mashed them up, and given life to a signature style and a creature which is totally unique. This creature is currently brought to life for public consumption on a bi-weekly basis at Moonshake, a collaboration with fellow DJ’s Dr. Indulgent + Bob Dazzla in San Diego."" /  / Vinyl Pop Up Curated By Pacific Beach Vinyl","('32.7169436', '-117.1692461')"

Michael David and Tyler Blake formed the production duo in Los Angeles in 2005, initially under the name Young Americans. Friends since childhood, David had previously worked as a session guitarist and Blake had just finished music school when, in their early twenties, they decided to make electronic music together. The pair started playing house parties and remixing artists, focusing on indie rock (including Kill Hannah and Hellogoodbye). The duo changed their name to Classixx in 2008, debuting with a self-titled EP. Soon after, the single ""I'll Get You"" (featuring Jeppe of Junior Senior) appeared on Kitsuné Music, in addition to remixes of songs by Phoenix, Fischerspooner, Yacht, Holy Ghost!, and numerous others. In 2010, they produced Mayer Hawthorne's ""No Strings."" Signing to the Mountain Dew-funded Green Label Sound, the single ""Into the Valley"" was released in 2011. Two years later their debut full-length, Hanging Gardens, appeared on Innovative Leisure. Including ""I'll Get You"" in addition to songs featuring Active Child and LCD Soundsystem/the Juan MacLean's Nancy Whang, the album was critically acclaimed, and the duo became a popular touring act. Classixx's next album featured a wide range of guest vocalists, including Passion Pit's Michael Angelakos, De Luxe, Isles, Harriet Brown, and T-Pain.

Gigging from the Tate Modern to MOMA, stadiums, cranes, hotels, car parks, bridges, deserts, fashion launches, mountains, muddy fields, beaches, not to mention the most prestigious clubs in the world. Critical and fan support have closely followed her career with Maya picking up multiple awards including Beatport's 'Staff Pick: Artist of the year' and ‘Best Producer', ‘Best DJ’, ‘Best Compilation’ or ‘Best Underground Track’ from Mixmag and DJ to FACT and SPIN. /  / Indeed, Maya has already graced the cover of over 20 magazines in 8 different countries including twice for Mixmag (UK), DJ Mag (UK), Village Voice (USA), Trax (France), Groove (Germany) and Vicious (Spain), alongside coverage as diverse as Vogue and Nylon through to Rolling Stone, Wall Street Journal and GQ. Maya even found time to front an international campaign for Dr. Martens. /  / So why all the fuss? Well, Maya is somewhat of an enigma; on a typical Maya Jane Coles record, Maya will have written, produced, engineered, arranged, mixed and performed every element of the track; some times top-lining and, on many occasions, even designing the sleeve artwork too. Maya is no overnight success, rather someone who has been paying their dues and honing their craft for years… /  / First intrigued by the musical mixture of sounds from dub to punk to soul to jazz to world to classical music played at home; Maya began to pick up a few instruments herself and started song writing. /  / Production felt like the natural next step to release her own vision at every part of the process from beginning to end. First producing hip-hop at 15, Maya migrated to dubbier electronic sounds aged 16 and following the experience of exploring good underground house in the clubs and warehouses of East London she started to make house records, culminating in her first release ‘Sick Panda’ on Dogmatik back in in 2007. The release led to gigs at events like the BBC Electric Proms and Bestival. /  / Whilst earlier tracks were all well received it is arguably ‘What They Say’, originally released on Real Tone, that would see Maya rise up the ranks of the underground house scene. Topping both the sales charts on Beatport and Resident Advisor’s charts week upon week. Further Maya productions ‘Don’t Put Me In Your Box’ EP (Hypercolour), ‘Humming Bird’ EP (Hypercolour), ‘Focus Now’ EP (20:20 Vision), ‘Beat Faster’ EP (Mobilee) cemented her position and built anticipation for Maya’s debut LP ‘Comfort’. /  / Led by the single ‘Easier to Hide’ in 2012, July 2013 saw the release of Maya’s debut album ‘Comfort’ on her I/AM/ME imprint. The record was produced, engineered and mixed solely by Maya herself. She even created the artwork for the album and all of the singles. Maya's debut was critically acclaimed, delivering an eclectic melting pot of sound and texture drawing on everything from house and techno through to R&B and Dub. Vocal guests on the record included Tricky, Miss Kittin, Kim Ann Foxman, Karin Park, Nadine Shah and Thomas Knights; the latter also directed two of the album’s music videos! /  / 2014 saw a club smash ‘Getting Freaky’ on Heidi's Jackathon Jams and a return to Dogmatik with ‘Watcher’. Maya also collaborated with GAPS on a Mobilee EP release. Maya in turn released a GAPS album to mark the first release on I/AM/ME other than her own material in 2015. /  / In 2015, Maya’s eponymous album under her bass driven ‘Nocturnal Sunshine’ alias, won best Producer at the DJ Mag awards and was further included in DJ Mag’s Top 10 Albums of 2015. Again Maya took on all duties from music to artwork with Catnapp and Chelou the only guest artists on the album. Maya has also remixed emergent talents The Orb, Karin Park and Phil Kieran, and originals ‘Can’t Hide The Way I Feel/Broke’. Maya would debut the moniker on her own branded stage at Secret Garden and later play a handful of special gigs under the moniker alongside Jamie XX in NYC and Bonobo in London. /  / 2017 saw Maya release her most substantial body of work to date; her sophomore album ‘Take Flight’ on her own label, I/AM/ME. The 24 track album peaked at number 37 in the overall UK albums chart during the week of release, number 26 in the Independent label chart and number 15 in the Billboard Dance and Electronic Album Sales Chart. The album received immense support, receiving a 72% score on Metacritic, gaining coverage from a number of high tier publications including Mixmag, Pitchfork and Billboard, as well as receiving DSP support such as a banner on the iTunes Electronic page, a spot in Spotify New Releases, Apple Music New Releases and was named Beatport Artist of the Week. Maya gained 2 ‘Essential New Tunes’ from Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1 for two of her singles from the album, ‘Cherry Bomb’ and ‘Trails’ and to top of her year, she won Best Album and Best Producer at the DJ Mag Best of British Awards 2017 off the back of her ‘Take Flight’ album. /  / 2017/2018 also saw Maya gain a number of selected mix placements such as her Essential Mix, which was shortlisted for Essential Mix of the Year, Annie Mac’s Mini Mix, Channel 4 Best Before, Beats1 Mix as well as Radio 1 Live in Ibiza. As well as supporting Depeche Mode on the European tour and further releasing album EPs. /  / The end of 2018, saw Maya simultaneously release a new stand alone EP “Waves & Whirlwinds” as Maya Jane Coles and the first new music in years under her Nocturnal Sunshine alias the bass driven “Foundation/Heroes”. Maya would announce a second yet untitled Nocturnal Sunshine album will be released at some point in 2019. /  / Maya has also produced acts such as Alpines, Nimmo and Little Boots recently working with Chelou on his cult single ‘Halfway to Nowhere’ and five tracks on his forthcoming debut album. /  / Also a prolific remixer with Maya’s credits include Depeche Mode, The XX, Bonobo, Massive Attack, Tricky, Little Dragon, Sia, Florence & The Machine, Peaches, and even the legendary Ella Fitzgerald! /  / Maya’s breakthrough track ‘What They Say’ was slowed and looped to form the backing track for Nicki Minaj’s ‘Truffle Butter’.

His story is inspiring to anybody wanting to make their mark on dance music, his story is proof that good things happen to good people.  /  / Based in the North West of England, the much-liked DJ/producer has grown from humble beginnings as a resident DJ in 2011, honing his craft in the sweaty intimate basements of his hometown of Southport and growing through to supporting the likes of Masters At Work, and Dennis Ferrer at Southport Weekender.  /  / The DJ turned producer has since gone on to win numerous accolades with his studio exports, most notably being presented with an award for the biggest selling record of 2013 by Beatport for his sterling remix of Josh Butler’s ‘Got A Feeling’ on MTA Records, which was #1 for six weeks and would still today be the second highest selling record of all time on the platform.

A stand out release for both artists. /  / True to form, Bontan swiftly followed up with his debut on Hot Creations. The First Time EP was premiered by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1 and was supported by the likes of Faze Magazine, Tsugi and DJ Mag. It went on to receive over 300 radio plays worldwide and again streamed over 500,000 times as both tracks from the EP reached #3 (The First Time) and #8 (Personal Questions) in the Beatport Main Chart. There are not many acts who can stake a claim to three records in the top 10 chart at one time. /  / The First Time would go on to become Hot Creations biggest selling record of the year, and make Bontan the highest selling artist Beatport across all genres, laying the foundations for a defining year for the young artist. With a touring schedule reaching new territories including Australia, South America and North America, Bontan is proof that good things happen to good people.","('32.7456704100782', '-117.19137917135')"

Education. /  / Three intertwining principles that form the foundation of the career of B.Traits. A journey that has seen her relocate from British Columbia, Canada to London, England; cement her reputation as a trusted selector at countless leading music events; start ‘In Toto’, her record label; become an established and respected radio broadcaster for BBC Radio 1 through which she vehemently championed cutting edge underground electronic music for 6 years and become an advocate for drug education and nightlife preservation within her adopted home. Underpinning all these achievements is B’s passion for sounds from across the musical spectrum, and her now well documented rampant eclecticism. /  / A significant next step in her continuous path to being one of the most distinguished artists in her field is her own record label: In Toto. A desire for complete artistic freedom and a boundless musical direction lie at the heart of B’s decision to start her own imprint, which sees releases ranging from house to techno to electro, and everything in between. Of her label, B.Traits has said: “It is a vehicle for me to put out my own and other artists' music on both vinyl and digital format. Music that I make, music that I love and music that I wish to share with you.”  /  / Website: http://www.btraits.com /  / La Fleur / Don’t even think about putting Sweden’s La Fleur into a box. For a start, she’s had too many twists and turns in her career to be edged into one particular corner. She actually started her working life as a pharmacist – but despite her acute understanding of laboratories, her passion was for an altogether different kind of mixing. Building on the success of the ‘Flowerhead’ EP on her own label Power Plant, her key electronic releases so far have included the ‘Nightflow’ and ‘Arms Around’ EPs (remixed by Detroit legends Kenny Larkin and Carl Craig respectively), as well as remixes for both Kerri Chandler and Sasha. In 2018 she’s enjoying a rich vein of form, starting with the acclaimed ‘Exhaust’, which was released on Adam Beyer’s Truesoul imprint, followed by a strong EP in May titled ‘Outbreaker’ on Watergate Records, featuring a remix by Tuff City Kids, the buzzed side project of Gerd Janson. In August she laid down a critically acclaimed debut Essential Mix that received plaudits from across the industry. The year was also highlighted by a standout collaboration with Sasha titled ‘Förbindelse’ that was anointed Essential New Tune by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1. With a remix for Damian Lazarus & Ancient Moons due before the end of the year, alongside a heavy tour schedule that sees her play Junction 2, Oasis Festival, Melt Festival, Drumcode Festival and Warehouse Project, she’s making her mark as one of the most exciting talents in house and techno. The Mixmag Breakthrough DJ Award at the end of 2017 was certainly well-deserved /  / Instagram: www.instagram.com/lafleur_official /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / Spin Nightclub /  / www.spinnightclub.com/ / www.twitter.com/spinnightclub / www.instagram.com/spinnightclubsd /  / VIP: [email protected] or 619-333-0029 /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / FNGRS CRSSD: /  / Facebook: www.facebook.com/FNGRSCRSSD / Instagram: www.instagram.com/fngrscrssd / Twitter: www.twitter.com/FNGRSXCRSSD / Website: www.CRSSD.com","('32.7456704100782', '-117.19137917135')"

At the age of 22, while studying aerospace engineering in grad school, the Ohio native otherwise Ryan Chadwick landed a last-minute internship in the remote Japanese town of Kurashiki. Living alone and faced with a major language barrier, the novice musician bought a MIDI keyboard and started creating his own compositions, tapping into the elementary skills he’d gained by playing on a dusty old piano back in his college dorm. As he taught himself production, Chadwick began bringing his keyboard along while riding the bullet train all over Japan, taking in his beautifully strange surroundings and infusing those feelings of isolation and wonder into his music. /  / Website: http://www.musicbyotr.com /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / Bang Bang: /  / Facebook: www.facebook.com/BangBangSanDiego / Twitter: www.twitter.com/BangBangSD / Website: www.bangbangsd.com /  / For bottle service inquiries please contact: / Zane Dashty / (619)760-6761 / [email protected] /  / No flip flops / No Shorts / No Tank tops / No Jerseys /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / FNGRS CRSSD: /  / Facebook: www.facebook.com/FNGRSCRSSD / Instagram: www.instagram.com/fngrscrssd / Twitter: www.twitter.com/FNGRSXCRSSD / Website: www.CRSSD.com","('32.711737', '-117.159509')"
