00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.260
notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.200
In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.340
This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.560
that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.060
What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.300
[Intro Music]

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.480
A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.880
It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.360
Corona may spread via surfaces,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.720
but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.700
Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.740
say rubbing your eyes or nose.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.280
The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.860
Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.500
Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.420
The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.300
These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.420
Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.600
The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple:

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.760
copy and reassemble.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.240
It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.259
self-destruct.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.520
The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.640
The number of infected cells grows exponentially

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.480
After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.060
The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.620
your own immune system.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.620
The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.780
And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.280
Cells have neither ears nor eyes.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.840
They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040
Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.040
Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.740
In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.100
Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.580
First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.560
As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.900
The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.780
Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.769
The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.639
This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.119
In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.840
It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.640
Recovery begins.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.820
The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.580
But many cases become severe or even critical.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.240
We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.120
but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.400
Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.500
That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.460
Patients get pneumonia.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.660
Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.600
The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.120
And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.540
They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.240
The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.620
While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.760
we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.880
There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.560
Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.360
A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives;

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.120
a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.260
The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.180
because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.360
Why is this so bad?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.560
In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.840
If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.540
There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.760
People will die untreated.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.260
And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.280
If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.700
The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:01.420
To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.560
A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:12.320
Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.780
Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour,

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.080
to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things:

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.460
1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.980
Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.760
The soap is actually a powerful tool.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.840
The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.620
soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.900
It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:54.960
To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeÃ±os and want to put in your contact lenses next.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.520
The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.800
but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.520
If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function:

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:17.420
from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:24.600
On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.400
Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.320
But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.340
So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.700
None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.020
The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start;

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.560
if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.980
If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.400
And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.060
Literally, and

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.060
figuratively.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.880
A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.900
specially Our World In Data,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.620
the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.400
and how to make progress solving them.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.120
Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona pandemic
